# Rust Roadmap

## Foundation Phase (Weeks 1-4)

**Getting Started**
- Install Rust via rustup and set up your development environment
- Learn basic syntax: variables, data types, functions, and control flow
- Understand ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes - Rust's core concepts
- Practice with simple programs like calculators, temperature converters

**Key Resources**
- The Rust Book (official documentation)
- Rustlings exercises for hands-on practice
- Basic cargo commands and project structure

## Intermediate Phase (Weeks 5-12)

**Core Language Features**
- Structs, enums, and pattern matching
- Error handling with Result and Option types
- Traits and generics
- Collections (Vec, HashMap, etc.)
- Modules and crate organization

**Practical Application**
- Build command-line tools using clap or structopt
- File I/O and basic text processing
- Understanding the standard library
- Writing tests and documentation

## Advanced Beginner Phase (Weeks 13-20)

**Concurrency and Systems Programming**
- Threads, channels, and async programming
- Smart pointers (Box, Rc, Arc, RefCell)
- Unsafe Rust basics
- FFI (Foreign Function Interface)
- Memory management deep dive

**Projects to Build**
- Multi-threaded file processor
- Simple HTTP client/server
- Basic database interactions

## Advanced Phase (Months 6-12)

**Advanced Concepts**
- Macros (declarative and procedural)
- Advanced async patterns with tokio
- Zero-cost abstractions and performance optimization
- Advanced trait usage (associated types, higher-ranked trait bounds)
- Embedded Rust or WebAssembly

**Ecosystem Mastery**
- Popular crates: serde, reqwest, diesel, actix-web
- Cargo workspaces and advanced project organization
- Publishing crates to crates.io
- Contributing to open source projects

**Specialized Domains**
Choose based on your interests:
- Web development with frameworks like Axum or Actix
- Systems programming and OS development
- Game development with Bevy or other engines
- Blockchain and cryptocurrency projects
- Network programming and protocol implementation

## Expert Level (Year 2+)

**Deep Specialization**
- Compiler internals and contributing to rustc
- Advanced unsafe code and memory layouts
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Teaching and mentoring others
- Architecture and design of large Rust systems

## Learning Tips

**Practice Consistently**
- Code daily, even if just for 30 minutes
- Join the Rust community on Discord or Reddit
- Participate in coding challenges and advent of code

**Build Real Projects**
- Start with small utilities you'll actually use
- Gradually increase complexity
- Focus on solving real problems rather than toy examples

**Read Quality Code**
- Study popular open source Rust projects
- Read the standard library source code
- Follow Rust blogs and stay current with language developments
