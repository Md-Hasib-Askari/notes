# Consultative & Solution Selling

## 1. Core Concepts

- Consultative selling: Diagnose before you prescribe; center the conversation on the buyer’s job-to-be-done and constraints.
- Solution selling: Map pains to capabilities and quantified outcomes; design a solution (not a feature tour).
- Mutual Action Plan (MAP): Shared checklist and dates to move from evaluation to value in production.
- Multi-threading: Engage economic buyer, champion, end users, security, and procurement early.
- Value narrative: From problems → impact → capabilities → proof → ROI (Return on Investment).

## 2. Frameworks & Examples

- Discovery path (30–45 mins):
  - Context: Team, current state, key initiatives.
  - Problems: Top 3 pains and their business impact.
  - Constraints: Budget, timeline, compliance, integrations.
  - Success: Desired outcomes, metrics, decision criteria.
  - Next step: Confirm fit; suggest tailored demo/MAP.
- Demo structure:
  - Recap problems in their words → show 3–4 outcomes → tie each to a capability → prove with a case study/logos → confirm value.
- MAP template:
  - Week 1: Security/Legal docs, pilot scope, success metrics.
  - Week 2: Implementation plan, owners, timeline.
  - Week 3: Pilot start; weekly check-ins; success review; commercial discussion.

## 3. Actionable Techniques & Tools

- Prepare: Write 3 hypotheses about their pains and success metrics; validate or discard live.
- Ask layered questions: Open → probe → quantify → prioritize; summarize back.
- Record and tag: Use call recording (with consent) and tag themes; update CRM (Customer Relationship Management) notes.
- Assets: 1-page ROI calculator; security packet; 5-slide narrative deck; proposal template.
- Tools: Gong/Chorus (call insights), HubSpot/Pipedrive (CRM), Notion (MAPs), Google Slides/Keynote (decks).

## 4. Common Mistakes & Fixes

- Mistake: Feature dump. Fix: Organize around outcomes and jobs-to-be-done.
- Mistake: Skipping security/procurement early. Fix: Include them in MAP from Week 1.
- Mistake: No quantified value. Fix: Co-create a simple model with their numbers.
- Mistake: Single-threading. Fix: Ask for all stakeholders and map the buying committee.

## 5. Hands-on Exercises

- Guided: Draft a 6-question discovery guide and role-play with a peer; refine based on gaps.
- Guided: Build a 1-page MAP for your current opportunity; validate owners and dates.
- Challenge: Convert a feature demo into a 6-slide outcome narrative with one quantified proof per outcome.
