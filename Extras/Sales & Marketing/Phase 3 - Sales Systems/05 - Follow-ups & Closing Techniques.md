# Follow-ups & Closing Techniques

## 1. Core Concepts

- Follow-up discipline: Deals are won in follow-up; every interaction should create momentum to a clear next step.
- Closing as confirming value: Closing is not a trick—it confirms that the value outweighs cost and risk.
- Commercial levers: Term length, payment schedule, onboarding services, and limited-time offers.
- Legal and security: Pre-empt review by sharing documents early; align on non-negotiables.

## 2. Frameworks & Examples

- Recap emails (R-A-P): Recap, Ask, Plan with dates/owners.
- Closing checklist:
  - Problem/value recap with numbers
  - Final scope and plan
  - Pricing and terms
  - Start date and success criteria
- Negotiation principles:
  - Trade, don’t cave: Offer value-for-value changes.
  - Anchor on ROI (Return on Investment) and outcomes; keep price-value link strong.
  - Use deadlines ethically (e.g., quarter-end provisioning, promo windows).

## 3. Actionable Techniques & Tools

- Calendar the next step before leaving the call; send recap within 24 hours.
- Use proposal software for clarity and speed; include e-sign and payment.
- Create a common redlines library with Legal to accelerate review.
- Tools: PandaDoc/DocuSign (proposals/signature), Notion (negotiation notes), CRM tasks (follow-up), Calendar.

## 4. Common Mistakes & Fixes

- Mistake: Open loops. Fix: Always set a date/owner and recap by email.
- Mistake: Discount-first. Fix: Revisit value and scope; trade for term or reference.
- Mistake: Legal pile-up at the end. Fix: Start security/legal in Week 1 with a Mutual Action Plan (MAP).

## 5. Hands-on Exercises

- Guided: Create a 7-step follow-up sequence template including two recap email examples.
- Guided: Build a negotiation “give-get” list with acceptable trades and hard stops.
- Challenge: Close one pilot with a clear success plan and a time-bound upgrade path.
