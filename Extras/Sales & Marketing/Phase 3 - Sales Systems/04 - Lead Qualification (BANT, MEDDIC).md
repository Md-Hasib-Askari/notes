# Lead Qualification (BANT, MEDDIC)

## 1. Core Concepts

- Qualification: Assess fit and readiness so you focus time where there’s mutual value.
- BANT — Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline: Lightweight framework for early-stage qualification.
- MEDDIC — Metrics, Economic buyer, Decision criteria, Decision process, Identify pain, Champion: For complex Business-to-Business (B2B) deals.
- PQL — Product Qualified Lead: Route high-value in-product users to Sales with a clear Service Level Agreement (SLA).
- Fit vs Intent: Fit (Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) match) × intent (behavioral signals) informs priority.

## 2. Frameworks & Examples

- BANT questions:
  - Budget: “How are similar tools typically funded?”
  - Authority: “Who else should be involved in evaluating this?”
  - Need: “Which problems would this solve in the next quarter?”
  - Timeline: “Is there a deadline or event driving this?”
- MEDDIC checks:
  - Metrics: “What would success look like in numbers?”
  - Economic buyer: “Who signs off and what do they care about?”
  - Decision criteria/process: “What criteria and steps will you use?”
  - Pain: “What happens if this isn’t solved?”
  - Champion: “Who benefits most and will advocate internally?”
- Routing logic example: High ICP score + visited pricing + invited teammate → fast-track to Account Executive (AE).

## 3. Actionable Techniques & Tools

- Create a scorecard in the CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and require fields for stage progression.
- Align with Marketing on MQL (Marketing Qualified Lead) thresholds and PQL triggers.
- Add disqualification reasons to learn and refine targeting.
- Tools: HubSpot/Pipedrive (scorecards/automation), Clearbit/Apollo (enrichment), Amplitude (intent signals).

## 4. Common Mistakes & Fixes

- Mistake: Over-qualifying early. Fix: Use BANT-light to keep momentum; validate deeper after demo.
- Mistake: Ignoring negative signals. Fix: Capture and report patterns; adjust campaigns.
- Mistake: No routing SLAs. Fix: Define response times and owner per lead type.

## 5. Hands-on Exercises

- Guided: Build a 10-point ICP + intent scorecard and test it on 20 leads.
- Guided: Draft your MEDDIC checklist for your top segment.
- Challenge: Implement auto-routing for PQLs with alerts to AEs; measure Speed-to-Lead.
