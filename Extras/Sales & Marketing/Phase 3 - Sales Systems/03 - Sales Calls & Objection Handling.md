# Sales Calls & Objection Handling

## 1. Core Concepts

- Call objectives: Discovery (learn), Demo (show outcomes), Technical (validate), Commercial (align on terms).
- Objection categories: Priority, Fit, Timing, Price, Risk. Treat objections as requests for more information.
- Frameworks: LAER — Listen, Acknowledge, Explore, Respond. Feel–Felt–Found as a simple pattern.
- Next-step clarity: Every call ends with a documented next step, owner, and date in the CRM (Customer Relationship Management).

## 2. Frameworks & Examples

- Call flow (discovery):
  - Agenda and time check → context → problems → impact → current solutions → constraints → success → next steps.
- Demo flow:
  - Recap problems → 3 outcomes → show capability → share proof → confirm value → next step.
- Objection playbook examples:
  - “No budget”: Reframe to ROI (Return on Investment) and opportunity cost; propose pilot and success criteria.
  - “Security risk”: Share security packet, references, and sandbox access.
  - “Too complex”: Offer implementation plan and hands-on support.

## 3. Actionable Techniques & Tools

- Prep: Write 5 questions you must answer by end of call; prepare a 3-slide recap.
- Record + tag: With consent, record and tag themes; share a 2-minute highlight.
- Leave-behind: Send a 3-bullet recap, confirmed next step, and 1 relevant proof link.
- Tools: Gong/Chorus (recording), Slides/Keynote (decks), Notion (playbooks), CRM tasks (follow-ups).

## 4. Common Mistakes & Fixes

- Mistake: Talking > listening. Fix: Aim for 60/40 listening/talking on discovery.
- Mistake: Demoing everything. Fix: Show only what ties to their outcomes.
- Mistake: Vague next steps. Fix: Calendar invite with agenda and goals; MAP (Mutual Action Plan) when appropriate.

## 5. Hands-on Exercises

- Guided: Create a 10-question objection log; write 2 responses per objection.
- Guided: Draft a 5-slide demo outline with one proof per outcome.
- Challenge: Run 5 discovery calls and share a 1-page pattern summary; update your playbook.
