# Product-Led Growth Basics

## 1. Core Concepts

- Product-Led Growth (PLG): Acquiring, activating, and expanding customers primarily through the product experience.
- PQL — Product Qualified Lead: A lead that has demonstrated value through in-product behavior (e.g., reached an "aha" moment, invited a teammate).
- Time-to-Value (TTV): How quickly users reach a meaningful outcome post-signup.
- Onboarding: The guided path that moves users to activation; checklists, templates, and in‑app guidance.
- Monetization: Free, free trial, freemium, usage-based; align paywalls with value moments.

## 2. Frameworks & Examples

- Activation checklist: Complete profile → import data → first success (e.g., run a job) → share/invite.
- PQL scoring: Mix event milestones (e.g., 3 projects created), firmographics (Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) fit), and intent (visited pricing page).
- Paywall placement: After first value; allow exploration pre-pay; test soft vs hard gates.
- Expansion loops: Team invites, templates marketplace, usage thresholds that trigger plan upgrades.

## 3. Actionable Techniques & Tools

- Instrument first-run: Track completion of each onboarding step; add just-in-time hints.
- Templates: Provide “blank page killers” so users start fast; import from popular tools.
- In‑app nudges: Contextual tips, checklists, and celebratory moments post-success.
- Tooling: Appcues/Chameleon (guidance), Amplitude/Mixpanel (product analytics), Stripe/Paddle (billing), LaunchDarkly (feature flags).

## 4. Common Mistakes & Fixes

- Mistake: Gating value too early. Fix: Let users experience a core result before requiring payment.
- Mistake: One-size onboarding. Fix: Path by persona/role and use case.
- Mistake: No Sales assist. Fix: Route high-value PQLs to Sales with a clear Service Level Agreement (SLA).
- Mistake: Neglecting expansion. Fix: Add usage-based nudges and team features to drive upgrades.

## 5. Hands-on Exercises

- Guided: Define your activation events and build a 5-step onboarding checklist tied to them.
- Guided: Draft a PQL scoring rubric with 3 events + 2 profile signals; document routing rules.
- Challenge: Move one paywall to a later moment; measure changes in Activation and conversion to paid over 2–4 weeks.
