# Storytelling in Tech Marketing

## 1. Core Concepts

- Narrative as a differentiator: Stories make complex tech memorable and relatable.
- Hero’s Journey (adapted): Customer (hero) faces a problem, meets a guide (you), gets a plan, avoids failure, achieves success.
- Category narrative: Define a change in the world that makes your approach necessary.
- Credibility: Back the story with proof—metrics, logos, demos, and expert endorsements.

## 2. Frameworks & Examples

- Three-act structure:
  - Act I: Status quo + inciting incident (e.g., rising costs, new regulation).
  - Act II: Search and struggle; failed attempts and tradeoffs of alternatives.
  - Act III: Transformation with your product; new capabilities and outcomes.
- One-liner formula: Problem + Solution + Result for a specific persona.
- Example narrative: “Legacy monitoring tools miss ephemeral services; teams drown in false positives. With service-aware tracing and adaptive baselines, teams cut incident Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR) by 42%.”

## 3. Actionable Techniques & Tools

- Story bank: Collect win stories, before/after screenshots, quotes, and short clips.
- Slides and pages: Each slide/section should answer: what, why now, why this, why us, proof.
- Delivery: Tell stories in demos; narrate the click path in terms of user outcomes.
- Tools: Google Slides/Keynote (decks), Figma (visuals), Loom (story clips), Notion (story bank).

## 4. Common Mistakes & Fixes

- Mistake: Product as hero. Fix: Make the customer the hero; you are the guide.
- Mistake: No conflict. Fix: Show real tradeoffs and costs of the status quo.
- Mistake: Unsubstantiated claims. Fix: Add numbers, third-party validation, and named logos where permitted.
- Mistake: Overlong stories. Fix: Aim for 30–60 second versions; link to deep dives.

## 5. Hands-on Exercises

- Guided: Write a one-liner and a 90‑second story for your top persona; include one quantified proof.
- Guided: Create a 6‑slide narrative deck (problem, impact, failed attempts, your approach, proof, next step).
- Challenge: Record a 2‑minute demo story focusing on outcomes; share with 5 users and capture feedback.
