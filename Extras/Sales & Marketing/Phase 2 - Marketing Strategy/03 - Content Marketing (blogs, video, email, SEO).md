# Content Marketing (blogs, video, email, SEO)

## 1. Core Concepts

- Content strategy: Align topics with Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD), lifecycle stage, and business goals.
- Topic clusters: One pillar page + interlinked cluster articles to build topical authority and Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
- Distribution: “Create once, distribute many”: blog → LinkedIn/Twitter → newsletter → short video.
- Editorial calendar: Cadence, owners, deadlines, and performance goals.
- E‑E‑A‑T — Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness: Signals for ranking and credibility.

## 2. Frameworks & Examples

- Content by funnel stage:
  - Top-of-funnel: Educational posts, primers, benchmarks.
  - Mid-funnel: How‑to guides, comparisons, case studies.
  - Bottom-funnel: ROI (Return on Investment) calculators, migration guides, demos.
- Email lifecycle:
  - Welcome: Set expectations, quick-start resources.
  - Nurture: Problem-solution stories, social proof, invitations to webinars.
  - Product updates: What changed and why it matters; link to docs/changelog.
- Video formats: Explainers, walkthroughs, customer stories, live Q&A, webinars.

## 3. Actionable Techniques & Tools

- Research: Use Ahrefs/Google Search Console, community threads, and support tickets for topics.
- Briefs: Define audience, search intent, outline, keyword targets, internal links, and CTAs (Calls To Action).
- Repurposing: Turn each post into a thread, a short video, a newsletter section, and a demo snippet.
- Measurement: Track Organic Click-Through Rate (CTR), time on page, scroll depth, assisted conversions.
- Tools: Notion (calendar/briefs), Ahrefs/Surfer (SEO), Loom (demos), Descript/CapCut (editing), Mailchimp/Brevo (email), Webflow/WordPress (Content Management System (CMS)).

## 4. Common Mistakes & Fixes

- Mistake: Publishing without promotion. Fix: Create a distribution checklist; schedule 3–5 posts per channel.
- Mistake: Topic drift. Fix: Tie every piece to a pillar/theme; update quarterly.
- Mistake: Thin content. Fix: Add examples, code, screenshots, and original data.
- Mistake: Ignoring inbox hygiene. Fix: Segment lists, prune bounces/inactives, set clear frequency.

## 5. Hands-on Exercises

- Guided: Build a 6‑week editorial calendar with one pillar and 6 cluster posts; include primary keywords and CTAs.
- Guided: Draft a 5‑email welcome sequence with one clear outcome per email.
- Challenge: Repurpose one post into three formats and report traffic and conversion by channel after 2 weeks.
