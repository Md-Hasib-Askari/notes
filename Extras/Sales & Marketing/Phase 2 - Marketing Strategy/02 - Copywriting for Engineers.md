# Copywriting for Engineers

## 1. Core Concepts

- Outcome-first: Lead with the result users achieve, not your feature list.
- Specificity and Proof: Quantify impact, cite real logos, show screenshots/GIFs.
- Clarity over cleverness: Simple language wins; avoid jargon unless your audience uses it.
- Information hierarchy: Headline → subhead → proof → CTA (Call To Action).
- Readability: Short sentences, active voice, scannable bullets, meaningful subheads.

## 2. Frameworks & Examples

- Headline formula: Outcome + Specific audience + Differentiator (e.g., “Ship reliable APIs 30% faster for Fintech teams, without flaky tests”).
- PASTOR framework — Problem, Amplify, Story, Transformation, Offer, Response (CTA).
- Before–After–Bridge: Paint the current pain, the improved future, and how you get them there.
- Example block (hero section):
  - Headline: “Cut build times in half for monorepos.”
  - Subhead: “Automated caching and parallelization tuned for large codebases.”
  - Proof: “Teams like Acme and Globex reduced cycle time by 47%.”
  - CTA: “Start a free 14‑day trial.”

## 3. Actionable Techniques & Tools

- Voice of Customer (VoC): Reuse exact phrases from interviews, support tickets, and community posts.
- Objection-first copy: Address top 3 concerns near the CTA (security, migration, lock-in).
- Microcopy: Improve button labels, error messages, and tooltips—small changes drive CR (Conversion Rate).
- Testing: A/B test headlines, subheads, and CTAs; test images and layout last.
- Tools: Hemingway/Grammarly (readability), Google Docs/Figma (drafts), Hotjar polls (insights), Google Optimize/Optimizely (tests).

## 4. Common Mistakes & Fixes

- Mistake: Feature soup. Fix: Map features → benefits → outcomes; keep features as proof.
- Mistake: Vague claims. Fix: Add numbers, screenshots, demos, and customer quotes.
- Mistake: Buried CTAs. Fix: Place primary CTA above the fold and at each major section end.
- Mistake: Inconsistent tone. Fix: Create a one-page style guide and examples.

## 5. Hands-on Exercises

- Guided: Rewrite your homepage hero using the headline formula and add one quantified proof.
- Guided: Extract 10 VoC quotes and turn 3 into headlines; test with 5 users.
- Challenge: Improve a key microcopy flow (signup or checkout) and report CR impact over 2 weeks.
