# Final Capstone: Build & Sell Your Own Offer

## 1. Core Concepts

- End-to-end application: Synthesize positioning, content, outreach, and sales into a single small project.
- Scope small, learn fast: Optimize for speed to market and feedback cycles.
- Evidence-led: Capture proof and learnings for reuse (case study, testimonials).

## 2. Project Outline (Example)

- Week 1: Define ICP (Ideal Customer Profile), value proposition, and a simple landing page.
- Week 2: Publish 2 content pieces and a lead magnet; open a simple email sequence.
- Week 3: Run light paid tests and/or targeted outreach; book 3 calls.
- Week 4: Close 1–2 paid customers; deliver and collect proof (quotes/metrics).

## 3. Success Criteria & Metrics

- Inputs: 4 content pieces, 1 landing page, 1 lead magnet, 1 sequence, 10 outreach messages/week.
- Outputs: Calls booked, trials started, sales closed.
- Outcome: Documented case study with before/after metrics and testimonial.

## 4. Common Pitfalls & Fixes

- Mistake: Overbuilding before validation. Fix: Launch the simplest version and iterate.
- Mistake: Skipping sales conversations. Fix: Book calls early to learn.
- Mistake: No proof capture. Fix: Ask for quotes and track outcomes throughout.

## 5. Delivery Checklist

- Landing page with clear offer and CTA (Call To Action)
- Content pieces and distribution plan
