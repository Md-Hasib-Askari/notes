# Freelancing / SaaS Selling Strategy

## 1. Core Concepts

- Offers: Define outcomes (deliverables + transformation), not hourly buckets.
- Niching: Specific industries/problems make outreach and referrals easier.
- Packaging & pricing: Fixed-scope packages, productized services, or usage-based for SaaS (Software as a Service).
- Pipeline health: Maintain top/mid/bottom-of-funnel activities weekly.

## 2. Frameworks & Examples

- Offer design:
  - Problem → Plan → Proof → Price → Process → Promise (risk reversal).
- Pricing menu:
  - Starter (1 problem), Core (flagship outcome), Plus (faster/concierge), Retainer (ongoing outcomes).
- SaaS motions: Free trial → PQL (Product Qualified Lead) → Sales assist for high-value accounts.

## 3. Actionable Techniques & Tools

- Proposal checklist: Outcome, scope, timeline, proof, price, next step, terms.
- Referrals: Build a partner list; create simple referral terms.
- Tools: Notion (offers), PandaDoc/DocuSign (proposals), Stripe (payments), HubSpot/Pipedrive (CRM).

## 4. Common Mistakes & Fixes

- Mistake: Selling time. Fix: Sell outcomes with clear scope and value.
- Mistake: Too many offers. Fix: Focus on 1–2 offers that win repeatedly.
- Mistake: Feast-or-famine. Fix: Calendar weekly prospecting and content.

## 5. Hands-on Exercises

- Guided: Create a 1-page flagship offer with proof and risk reversal.
- Guided: Build a 3-tier pricing page and test with 5 target users.
- Challenge: Close one client using your new offer; document the process and results.
