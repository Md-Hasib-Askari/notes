# Building a Marketing Engine for Your Projects

## 1. Core Concepts

- Owned system: Website, newsletter, and repeatable content flywheels that don’t rely solely on rented channels.
- ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) for your project: Define who benefits most and why they switch.
- Offers: Free lead magnet, low-ticket product, core offer; clear ladders between them.
- Consistency: Cadence beats bursts; small repeatable actions compound.

## 2. Frameworks & Examples

- Weekly engine:
  - Publish 1 value-dense post → repurpose to 2 platforms → snippet to newsletter → capture signups → nurture.
- Content flywheel: Problems you solved → write/talk → feedback → refine → productize.
- Offer ladder: Free checklist → $29 mini product → core $199–$999 offer → subscription.

## 3. Actionable Techniques & Tools

- Platform: Simple site (Webflow/WordPress) + email (Beehiiv/Mailchimp) + analytics (GA4).
- Calendar: 90-day content plan tied to your audience’s Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD).
- Measurement: Track CTR (Click-Through Rate), signups, replies, and sales; iterate monthly.
- Tools: Notion (ideas), Figma/Canva (visuals), Loom (demos), Gumroad/Stripe (payments).

## 4. Common Mistakes & Fixes

- Mistake: Overbuilding. Fix: Launch with the smallest viable engine and improve.
- Mistake: Platform chasing. Fix: Master one channel before adding others.
- Mistake: No clear offer. Fix: Create one core offer and a simple path to it.

## 5. Hands-on Exercises

- Guided: Define your ICP and write a one-sentence value proposition.
- Guided: Build a 12‑week content calendar with themes and CTAs (Calls To Action).
- Challenge: Launch a simple lead magnet and measure signups and sales over 4 weeks.
