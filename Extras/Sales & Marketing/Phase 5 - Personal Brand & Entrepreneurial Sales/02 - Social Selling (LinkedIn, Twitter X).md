# Social Selling (LinkedIn, Twitter/X)

## 1. Core Concepts

- Give > ask: Share useful insights, build trust, then make clear offers.
- Content–Conversation loop: Posts → comments/DMs → calls → case studies → more posts.
- Positioning: Be known for a specific “lane” (e.g., “deploys that don’t break”).
- Proof over polish: Consistent, honest wins beat perfect production.

## 2. Frameworks & Examples

- Weekly cadence:
  - 3 posts: one insight, one story, one proof/win.
  - 15 meaningful comments on target accounts.
  - 10 DMs: follow-ups, intros, invites.
- Post formulas:
  - Problem → why it persists → 3-step fix → CTA (Call To Action).
  - Story → lesson → actionable steps.
- Examples: Before/after screenshots, short Looms, quantified results.

## 3. Actionable Techniques & Tools

- Profiles: Clear headline, pinned offer, proof highlights.
- List-building: Save accounts/creators in lists; engage consistently.
- Analytics: Track impressions, profile views, link clicks, replies → calls.
- Tools: Shield/Typefully/Hypefury (scheduling/analytics), Figma/Canva (visuals), Loom (clips), Calendly (booking).

## 4. Common Mistakes & Fixes

- Mistake: Broadcasting only. Fix: Spend equal time on comments and DMs.
- Mistake: Random topics. Fix: Stay within 3–4 themes tied to your offer.
- Mistake: No offer path. Fix: Add a simple CTA and link in every relevant post.

## 5. Hands-on Exercises

- Guided: Write/update your LinkedIn/X profile to align with your offer.
- Guided: Draft 9 posts (3 weeks) using the formulas and schedule them.
- Challenge: Book 5 calls in 4 weeks via social; document what worked.
