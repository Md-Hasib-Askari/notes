# Positioning and Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

## 1. Core Concepts

- Positioning: How your product is perceived in the minds of target customers relative to alternatives; defines category, audience, value, and proof.
- Unique Selling Proposition (USP): The sharp, specific differentiator that matters to the buyer—feature, mechanism, promise, or go-to-market advantage.
- Category choice: Create, redefine, or compete within. Category language shapes expectations and comparisons.
- Moats: Data advantage, network effects, workflow lock-in, ecosystem partnerships.

## 2. Frameworks & Examples

- Positioning Canvas (Ries/Trout + April Dunford):
  - Competitive alternatives, key unique attributes, value (outcomes), customer segments, market category, proof.
- Laddering & Reframing: If top rung is owned by a leader, claim a different rung (speed, security, simplicity) or a new ladder (category).
- Example: “The secure Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent platform for regulated teams” → differentiates on governance and compliance vs. generic AI tools.

## 3. Actionable Techniques & Tools

- Gather 10 win stories and 10 loss reasons; extract unique attributes buyers valued.
- Write a one-page Positioning Narrative; stress test with top customers and prospects.
- Align website nav and pricing to positioning (plans/features mirror value pillars).
- Tooling: Strategy documents in Notion, messaging tests with Google Ads/LinkedIn, competitive matrix in Google Sheets/Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Clarity for message testing.

## 4. Common Mistakes & Fixes

- Mistake: Declaring USPs that don’t matter. Fix: Anchor differentiators to valued outcomes in win stories.
- Mistake: Copying competitor language. Fix: Adopt distinct phrasing and category cues.
- Mistake: Inconsistent execution. Fix: Train Sales enablement and update content/collateral.
