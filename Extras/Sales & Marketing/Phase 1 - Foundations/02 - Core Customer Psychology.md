# Core Customer Psychology

## 1. Core Concepts

- Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD): Customers “hire” products to make progress in a situation; focus on outcomes, not demographics.
- Pain, Desire, Risk: Decisions balance pain relief and desired gain versus perceived risk (money, time, status).
- Motivations: Functional, emotional, and social jobs. Emotional risk often blocks adoption even when ROI is clear.
- Heuristics & Biases: Loss aversion, social proof, authority, anchoring, and friction costs shape buying.
- Buying committee: In B2B, multiple roles (economic buyer, champion, users, security) with different psych drivers.

## 2. Frameworks & Examples

- JTBD interview template: Situation → Struggle → Existing workaround → Aha moment → Desired outcome → Purchase/Adoption trigger.
- Four Forces of Progress (Christensen): Push of situation, Pull of new solution, Anxiety of adoption, Habit of present. Craft messaging to increase Pull/Push and reduce Anxiety/Habit.
- Value Equation: (Dream outcome × Perceived likelihood of achievement) / (Time delay × Effort & Sacrifice). Make results feel likely; reduce time/effort.
- Example: Developer tool adoption
  - Champion cares about speed/productivity (emotional: pride, competence).
  - Security cares about risk/compliance (risk minimization dominates).
  - Economic buyer cares about ROI, total cost, alternatives (anchoring vs status-quo bias).

## 3. Actionable Techniques & Tools

- Run 6–10 JTBD interviews; synthesize top 5 outcomes; extract language for copy.
- Objection log per persona; preempt with Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), one-pagers, security documents.
- Social proof ladder: reviews → case studies → quantified ROI → peer references.
- Reduce friction: quick-starts, templates, risk reversals (free trial, pilot, guarantee).
- Tools: Typeform/Google Forms (surveys), Dovetail/Affinity (research), Notion (objection wiki), Gong (voice of customer), Hotjar (friction mapping).

## 4. Common Mistakes & Fixes

- Mistake: Feature-first messaging. Fix: Outcome-first headlines using customer words.
- Mistake: Ignoring anxiety/friction. Fix: Add security/IT artifacts, implementation timelines, and concierge onboarding.
- Mistake: One-size-fits-all. Fix: Persona-specific pages and nurture tracks.

## 5. Hands-on Exercises

- Guided: Conduct 3 JTBD interviews and highlight exact phrases to reuse in copy.
- Guided: Create a 1-page objection handling sheet for the top persona.
- Challenge: Redesign your onboarding to reduce time-to-first-value by 50%.
