# Market Research & Customer Segmentation

## 1. Core Concepts

- TAM/SAM/SOM: Market sizing hierarchy; use SOM to define near-term focus.
- Segmentation lenses: firmographic, technographic, behavioral, need-based (JTBD), maturity.
- ICP definition: Must-have pains, budget authority, ecosystem fit, willingness to change.
- Research methods: Primary (interviews, surveys), Secondary (reports, search data), Observational (product analytics, communities).

## 2. Frameworks & Examples

- ICP Scoring Model: 0–5 score for industry, size, tool stack, compliance needs, pain intensity; threshold for routing.
- Segmentation matrix: Map segments by LTV/CAC and strategic value; prioritize 2–3 segments.
- Example sources: G2/StackShare (technographics), LinkedIn Sales Navigator (firmographics), Reddit/Slack/Discord (needs), Search Console (intent).

## 3. Actionable Techniques & Tools

- Build a 1-page ICP scorecard used in SDR qualification and paid targeting.
- Create segment-specific landing pages and case studies.
- Use SQL/Python to pull cohort behavior (activation/retention) by segment for focus.
- Tools: Apollo/SN for lists, Ahrefs/GA4 for intent, Amplitude/Mixpanel for behavior, Looker/Metabase for dashboards.

## 4. Common Mistakes & Fixes

- Mistake: Overly broad ICP. Fix: Narrow to segments where you have repeatable wins and references.
- Mistake: Static segmentation. Fix: Revisit quarterly; adjust to win/loss and product evolution.
- Mistake: Jumping to channels before segment-proof. Fix: Validate segment-message fit with small paid tests.

## 5. Hands-on Exercises

- Guided: Build an ICP scorecard and test it on 20 recent opportunities.
- Guided: Draft two segment-specific pages differing in headline, proof, CTA.
- Challenge: Show a cohort chart comparing Week-4 retention across 3 segments; recommend focus.
