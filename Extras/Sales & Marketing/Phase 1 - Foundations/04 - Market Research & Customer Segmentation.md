# Market Research & Customer Segmentation

## 1. Core Concepts

- Total Addressable Market (TAM) / Serviceable Available Market (SAM) / Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM): Market sizing hierarchy; use SOM to define near-term focus.
- Segmentation lenses: firmographic, technographic, behavioral, need-based (Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)), maturity.
- Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) definition: Must-have pains, budget authority, ecosystem fit, willingness to change.
- Research methods: Primary (interviews, surveys), Secondary (reports, search data), Observational (product analytics, communities).

## 2. Frameworks & Examples

- Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) Scoring Model: 0–5 score for industry, size, tool stack, compliance needs, pain intensity; threshold for routing.
- Segmentation matrix: Map segments by Lifetime Value (LTV)/Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and strategic value; prioritize 2–3 segments.
- Example sources: G2/StackShare (technographics), LinkedIn Sales Navigator (firmographics), Reddit/Slack/Discord (needs), Google Search Console (intent).

## 3. Actionable Techniques & Tools

- Build a 1-page ICP scorecard used in SDR qualification and paid targeting.
- Create segment-specific landing pages and case studies.
- Use SQL/Python to pull cohort behavior (activation/retention) by segment for focus.
- Tools: Apollo/Sales Navigator (SN) for lists, Ahrefs/Google Analytics 4 (GA4) for intent, Amplitude/Mixpanel for behavior, Looker/Metabase for dashboards.

## 4. Common Mistakes & Fixes

- Mistake: Overly broad ICP. Fix: Narrow to segments where you have repeatable wins and references.
- Mistake: Static segmentation. Fix: Revisit quarterly; adjust to win/loss and product evolution.
- Mistake: Jumping to channels before segment-proof. Fix: Validate segment-message fit with small paid tests.

## 5. Hands-on Exercises

- Guided: Build an ICP scorecard and test it on 20 recent opportunities.
- Guided: Draft two segment-specific pages differing in headline, proof, Call To Action (CTA).
- Challenge: Show a cohort chart comparing Week-4 retention across 3 segments; recommend focus.
