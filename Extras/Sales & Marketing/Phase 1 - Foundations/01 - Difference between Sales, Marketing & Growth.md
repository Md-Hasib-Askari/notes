# Difference between Sales, Marketing & Growth

## 1. Core Concepts

- Sales: Turning qualified demand into revenue via human conversations and closing mechanics. Short-to-mid horizon. Account- and deal-level focus. Success = closed-won, Annual Contract Value (ACV), win-rate, sales cycle.
- Marketing: Creating and capturing demand at scale through market understanding, messaging, and channels. Mid-to-long horizon. Segment- and brand-level focus. Success = awareness, qualified pipeline (Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL)/Sales Qualified Lead (SQL)), Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) efficiency.
- Growth: Cross-functional, experiment-driven optimization of the entire product-customer lifecycle. Focus on loops and compounding effects. Success = activation, retention, expansion, Lifetime Value (LTV), viral coefficient.
- Handshake moments: Marketing → Sales (MQL → SQL/Opportunity), Product/Growth → Sales (PQLs), Post-sale Growth (expansion, referrals).
- Ownership vs accountability: Marketing owns demand creation; Sales owns conversion; Growth orchestrates compounding systems across the journey.

## 2. Frameworks & Examples

- Full-funnel view:
  - Awareness (Marketing-led) → Consideration (Marketing + Sales enablement) → Evaluation (Sales-led with Product assist) → Purchase (Sales) → Onboarding (Growth + CS) → Retention/Expansion (Growth + CS + Sales) → Advocacy (Marketing + Growth).
- Role alignment by motion:
  - SLG (Sales-Led Growth): outbound, events, Account-Based Marketing (ABM); heavy Sales enablement.
  - PLG (Product-Led Growth): self-serve trials, Product Qualified Leads (PQLs); Sales focuses on higher-Annual Contract Value (ACV) conversions/expansion.
  - MLG (Marketing-Led Growth): inbound content/Search Engine Optimization (SEO)/paid; Sales closes qualified inbound.
- Example mapping (SaaS):
  - Marketing: Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) + positioning → Search Engine Optimization (SEO) pillar pages → lead magnet → nurture → Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL).
  - Growth: in-app nudges → onboarding checklist → PQL scoring → handoff.
  - Sales: discovery → demo tailored to Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) → Return on Investment (ROI) case → negotiation → close.

## 3. Actionable Techniques & Tools

- Define lifecycle stages and Service Level Agreements (SLAs): Lead → Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL) → Sales Qualified Lead (SQL) → Opportunity → Closed Won/Lost with maximum handoff time (e.g., MQL to first-touch < 1 hour).
- Qualification: Adopt BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline)/MEDDIC (Metrics, Economic buyer, Decision criteria, Decision process, Identify pain, Champion) light for early-stage; template discovery notes in Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system.
- PQL scoring: Track product events (aha-moment, activation), firmographics, intent; route high Product Qualified Leads (PQLs) to an Account Executive (AE).
- Attribution basics: Use Urchin Tracking Module (UTM) parameters; define primary channel rules; dashboard MQL→SQL→Close conversion and Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)/Lifetime Value (LTV) by channel.
- Tooling: HubSpot or Pipedrive (Customer Relationship Management (CRM)), Google Analytics/Looker Studio, Segment/Amplitude (events), Calendly (booking), Gong (call insights).

## 4. Common Mistakes & Fixes

- Mistake: Treating Growth as “paid marketing.” Fix: Charter growth to own activation/retention loops and experimentation, not just acquisition.
- Mistake: Vanity metrics (website visits) without qualified pipeline. Fix: Report funnel conversion and revenue-driven Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
- Mistake: No clear lead/Product Qualified Lead (PQL) handoff. Fix: Document Service Level Agreements (SLAs), routing rules, and feedback loop between teams.
- Mistake: Siloed data. Fix: One Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system as source of truth; event tracking standardized IDs across tools.

## 5. Hands-on Exercises

- Guided: Map your current funnel with stages, owners, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Identify one broken handoff and propose a Service Level Agreement (SLA).
- Guided: Define a draft PQL score using 3 product behaviors + 2 firmographic signals.
- Challenge: Build a single-page dashboard showing MQL→SQL→Close conversion and CAC by top 3 channels. Recommend one reallocation.
