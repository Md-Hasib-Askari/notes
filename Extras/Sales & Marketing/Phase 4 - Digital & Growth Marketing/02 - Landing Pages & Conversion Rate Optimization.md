# Landing Pages & Conversion Rate Optimization

## 1. Core Concepts

- Message–Market–Moment fit: Align copy with ICP (Ideal Customer Profile), intent, and timing.
- Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO): Systematic testing to improve the percentage of visitors who take a desired action.
- Speed and clarity: Page load, visual hierarchy, and scannability drive outcomes.
- Risk reversal: Trials, guarantees, pilots reduce anxiety.

## 2. Frameworks & Examples

- Page structure:
  - Hero: Outcome-focused headline + subhead + primary CTA (Call To Action) + social proof.
  - Proof: Logos, numbers, quotes.
  - Value: 3 pillars with short explanations.
  - Details: How it works, integrations, security.
  - CTA: Repeated with variant (e.g., “Book demo” vs “Start free”).
- Test ideas:
  - Headlines/subheads, proof placement, CTAs, form fields, above-the-fold visuals.

## 3. Actionable Techniques & Tools

- Measurement: GA4 (Google Analytics 4), heatmaps (Hotjar), and scroll tracking.
- Technicals: Core Web Vitals, image optimization, minimal render-blocking.
- A/B testing: Optimizely/Visual Website Optimizer (VWO)/Google Optimize; run for at least one full cycle.
- Tools: Webflow/WordPress (Content Management System (CMS)), Figma (design), Ahrefs (Search Engine Optimization (SEO)), Looker Studio (dashboards).

## 4. Common Mistakes & Fixes

- Mistake: Too many CTAs. Fix: One primary action per page.
- Mistake: Form fatigue. Fix: Remove non-essential fields; use progressive profiling.
- Mistake: Slow pages. Fix: Optimize images, lazy-load, and reduce scripts.
- Mistake: Unclear offer. Fix: Rewrite headline with outcome and audience.

## 5. Hands-on Exercises

- Guided: Redesign a hero section with a clearer outcome and one quantified proof.
- Guided: Run a 2-week headline A/B test; report impact on CTR (Click-Through Rate) and conversion.
- Challenge: Improve Core Web Vitals to “Good” and measure conversion lift.
