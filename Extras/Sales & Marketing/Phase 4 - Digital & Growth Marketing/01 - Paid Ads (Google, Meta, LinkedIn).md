# Paid Ads (Google, Meta, LinkedIn)

## 1. Core Concepts

- Objective-first: Match campaign objective to funnel stage (awareness, lead gen, conversion).
- Targeting: Use ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) signals and intent; avoid overly narrow segments early.
- Creative–Audience–Offer fit: Align message and CTA (Call To Action) to the persona and stage.
- Measurement: Set up conversions, Urchin Tracking Module (UTM) parameters, and offline events where needed.
- Budgeting: Start small, learn fast; scale winners, pause losers.

## 2. Frameworks & Examples

- Channel strengths:
  - Google: Intent capture; search and Performance Max campaigns.
  - Meta (Facebook/Instagram): Pattern interrupt; education and retargeting.
  - LinkedIn: Business-to-Business (B2B) targeting by role, company, skills.
- Campaign structure:
  - Awareness: Video/explainer with soft CTA.
  - Consideration: Case study, webinar, checklist.
  - Conversion: Demo/trial, comparison page, ROI (Return on Investment) asset.
- Offers by stage: Lead magnet → webinar → trial/demo → case study → pricing consult.

## 3. Actionable Techniques & Tools

- Tracking: Configure Google Tag Manager, GA4 (Google Analytics 4) conversions, and LinkedIn Insight Tag.
- Creative: Test 3 hooks, 3 visuals, 2 CTAs; rotate weekly based on early signals.
- Landing pages: Align headline and creative; keep forms short; add social proof near CTAs.
- Tools: Ads Managers (Google, Meta, LinkedIn), Looker Studio (dashboards), Canva/Figma (creatives), Webflow/WordPress (landing pages).

## 4. Common Mistakes & Fixes

- Mistake: Campaign sprawl. Fix: Limit to a few hypotheses; kill underperformers quickly.
- Mistake: Mismatched intent. Fix: Search for bottom-funnel; social for education/retargeting.
- Mistake: No offline tracking. Fix: Import offline conversions from CRM (Customer Relationship Management).

## 5. Hands-on Exercises

- Guided: Launch one test per channel with a single hypothesis each; define success metrics upfront.
- Guided: Build a Looker Studio dashboard with cost, Cost Per Lead (CPL), and pipeline by channel.
- Challenge: Iterate creatives weekly for 3 weeks; report CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) and conversion changes.
