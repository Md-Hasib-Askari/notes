    def __init__(self):
        self.coordinator = CentralCoordinator()
        self.communication_hub = AgentCommunicationHub()
        self.resource_manager = SharedResourceManager()
        self.conflict_resolver = ConflictResolver()
    
    async def coordinate_complex_task(self, task):
        # Task decomposition
        subtasks = await self.coordinator.decompose_task(task)
        
        # Agent assignment
        agent_assignments = await self.coordinator.assign_agents(subtasks)
        
        # Parallel execution with coordination
        results = await self.execute_coordinated_workflow(agent_assignments)
        
        # Result synthesis
        final_result = await self.coordinator.synthesize_results(results)
        
        return final_result
```

### Coordination Patterns
```yaml
# coordination_config.yaml
coordination_patterns:
  hierarchical:
    structure: "master_coordinator -> team_leaders -> specialist_agents"
    use_case: "Complex project management with clear authority"
  
  peer_to_peer:
    structure: "agent_network with direct communication"
    use_case: "Collaborative problem-solving and knowledge sharing"
  
  marketplace:
    structure: "task_auction system with bidding agents"
    use_case: "Dynamic resource allocation and optimization"
  
  consensus:
    structure: "voting_based decision making"
    use_case: "Democratic decision processes and conflict resolution"
```

### Communication Protocols
- **Message Passing**: Structured inter-agent communication
- **Shared Memory**: Common knowledge base and context sharing
- **Event-Driven**: Reactive coordination based on system events
- **Negotiation**: Conflict resolution and resource allocation

## Project 3: Real-Time Decision-Making System

### Implementation Framework
```python
class RealTimeDecisionSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stream_processor = DataStreamProcessor()
        self.decision_engine = RealTimeDecisionEngine()
        self.action_executor = ActionExecutor()
        self.feedback_loop = FeedbackLoop()
    
    async def process_real_time_stream(self):
        async for data_point in self.stream_processor.stream():
            # Rapid analysis
            analysis = await self.decision_engine.analyze(data_point)
            
            # Decision making
            decision = await self.decision_engine.decide(analysis)
            
            # Action execution
            if decision.requires_action:
                result = await self.action_executor.execute(decision.action)
                await self.feedback_loop.update(result)
```

### Use Case Examples
