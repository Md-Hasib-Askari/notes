            "processor": DataProcessorAgent(),
            "analyzer": DataAnalyzerAgent(),
            "reporter": ReportGeneratorAgent()
        }
    
    async def execute_pipeline(self, data_sources):
        # Collect data
        raw_data = await self.agents["collector"].collect(data_sources)
        
        # Process and clean
        clean_data = await self.agents["processor"].process(raw_data)
        
        # Analyze and generate insights
        insights = await self.agents["analyzer"].analyze(clean_data)
        
        # Create final report
        report = await self.agents["reporter"].generate(insights)
        
        return report
