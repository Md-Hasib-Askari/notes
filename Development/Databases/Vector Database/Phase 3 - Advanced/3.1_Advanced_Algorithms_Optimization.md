# 3.1 Advanced Algorithms and Optimization

## Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)

ANN algorithms enable efficient similarity search in high-dimensional spaces by trading exact results for dramatic speed improvements.

### Trade-offs between Accuracy and Speed

- **Recall vs Query Time**:
  - Higher recall requires more computation
  - Diminishing returns beyond certain recall levels
  - Typical production targets: 90-99% recall

- **Memory vs Performance**:
  - Larger indexes improve accuracy but consume more memory
  - In-memory vs memory-mapped considerations
  - Cache efficiency impacts

- **Build Time vs Query Performance**:
  - More computation during index building can improve query speed
  - Index maintenance overhead with updates

### Recall vs Latency Optimization

- **Recall Definition**: percentage of true nearest neighbors found
  - Recall@k = |returned_neighbors ∩ true_neighbors| / |true_neighbors|

- **Strategies for Improvement**:
  - Query-time parameters adjustment
  - Multi-probe approaches
  - Post-processing reranking
  - Ensemble methods

- **Measurement Techniques**:
  - Ground truth generation using exact search
  - Recall-latency curves
  - Service level objectives (SLOs)

### Parameter Tuning Strategies

- **Systematic Approaches**:
  - Grid search for optimal parameters
  - Bayesian optimization
  - A/B testing in production

- **Key Parameters**:
  - HNSW: ef, M, efConstruction

## Quantization Techniques

### Scalar Quantization

- **Principle**:
  - Reduce precision of individual vector components
  - Map continuous values to discrete buckets
  - Trade precision for memory efficiency

- **Implementation**:
  - Linear quantization
  - Non-linear (logarithmic) quantization
  - Bit-width reduction (16/8/4-bit)

- **Performance Impact**:
  - Reduced memory footprint
  - Potential for SIMD acceleration
  - Minimal accuracy loss with proper calibration

### Product Quantization (PQ)

- **Core Technique**:
  - Split vector into m subvectors
  - Quantize each subvector independently
  - Combine quantized parts for final representation

- **Mathematical Foundation**:
  - Vector v = [v₁, v₂, ..., vₘ]
  - Each subvector vᵢ quantized to nearest centroid
  - Distance approximation via lookup tables

- **Parameters**:
  - Number of subvectors (m)
  - Bits per subvector (typically 8)
  - Training dataset selection

### Optimized Product Quantization (OPQ)

- **Enhancement over PQ**:
  - Applies rotation to data before quantization
  - Reduces quantization error
  - Better preserves distance relationships

- **Implementation**:
  - Eigen-decomposition of covariance matrix
  - Iterative optimization process
  - Training phase complexity

### Binary Quantization

- **Techniques**:
  - Binary hashing (1 bit per dimension)
  - Locality-sensitive binary codes
  - Hamming distance for similarity

- **Advantages**:
  - Extreme memory efficiency
  - Fast distance computation (bitwise operations)
  - Hardware acceleration opportunities

- **Applications**:
  - Large-scale retrieval
  - First-stage filtering
  - Mobile/edge deployment
