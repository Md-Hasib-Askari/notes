# 1.1 Mathematical Prerequisites for Vector Databases

## Linear Algebra Basics

### Vectors and Vector Spaces

Vectors are mathematical objects with both magnitude and direction. In the context of vector databases:
- **Definition**: A vector is an ordered list of numbers (components)
- **Notation**: v = [v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ] or v = (v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ)
- **Vector Space**: A collection of vectors that can be added together and multiplied by scalars
- **Dimensionality**: The number of components in a vector (n-dimensional)

In vector databases, each item (document, image, etc.) is represented as a vector in a high-dimensional space.

### Dot Product and Vector Similarity

The dot product is fundamental for measuring similarity between vectors:
- **Formula**: a · b = a₁b₁ + a₂b₂ + ... + aₙbₙ = Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ aᵢbᵢ
- **Properties**:
  - Commutative: a · b = b · a
  - Distributive: a · (b + c) = a · b + a · c
  - For perpendicular vectors: a · b = 0
- **Application**: Core operation in similarity search algorithms

### Euclidean Distance and L2 Norm

Measures the "straight-line" distance between two points in vector space:
- **L2 Norm (Vector Magnitude)**: ||v|| = √(v₁² + v₂² + ... + vₙ²) = √(v · v)
- **Euclidean Distance**: d(a,b) = ||a - b|| = √((a₁-b₁)² + (a₂-b₂)² + ... + (aₙ-bₙ)²)
- **Properties**:
  - Non-negative: d(a,b) ≥ 0
  - Identity: d(a,b) = 0 if and only if a = b
  - Symmetry: d(a,b) = d(b,a)
  - Triangle inequality: d(a,c) ≤ d(a,b) + d(b,c)
- **Application**: Used when absolute distances matter, good for dense, continuous data

### Cosine Similarity

Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors:
- **Formula**: cos(θ) = (a · b) / (||a|| × ||b||)
- **Range**: [-1, 1] where:
  - 1 means identical direction
  - 0 means orthogonal (perpendicular)
  - -1 means opposite direction
- **Application**: 
  - Ignores magnitude, focuses on orientation
  - Popular for text similarity (TF-IDF, embeddings)
  - Effective for sparse, high-dimensional data

### Matrix Operations Basics

Matrices are essential for understanding vector operations at scale:
- **Definition**: Rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns
- **Key Operations**:
  - Addition/Subtraction: Element-wise operations
  - Multiplication: (AB)ᵢⱼ = Σₖ AᵢₖBₖⱼ
  - Transpose: Aᵀ flips rows and columns
- **Application**: 
  - Batch processing of vectors
  - Dimensionality reduction techniques
  - Foundation for embedding generation algorithms

## Statistics Fundamentals

### Probability Distributions

- **Definition**: Mathematical function that provides probabilities for a random variable
- **Key Distributions**:
  - Normal (Gaussian): Bell-shaped curve, common in natural phenomena
  - Uniform: Equal probability across all values
  - Binomial: Discrete distribution for success/failure experiments
- **Application**: 
  - Modeling data uncertainty
  - Basis for probabilistic search algorithms
  - Foundation for random projections in LSH

### Variance and Standard Deviation

- **Variance**: σ² = E[(X - μ)²] = Average of squared differences from the mean
- **Standard Deviation**: σ = √σ² = Square root of variance
- **Properties**:
  - Measures data spread/dispersion
  - Same units as the original data (for standard deviation)
- **Application**: 
  - Quantifying uncertainty in vector representations
  - Normalizing features
  - Weighting in distance calculations

### Correlation vs Causation

- **Correlation**: 
  - Measures relationship strength between variables
  - Formula: r = Σ((x-x̄)(y-ȳ)) / (√Σ(x-x̄)² × √Σ(y-ȳ)²)
  - Range: [-1, 1]
- **Causation**: Direct influence of one variable on another
- **Important Distinction**: Correlation does not imply causation
- **Application**: 
  - Feature selection
  - Understanding relationships in vector components
  - Avoiding false assumptions in data representation

### Basic Statistical Measures

- **Central Tendency**:
  - Mean: Average of values
  - Median: Middle value
  - Mode: Most frequent value
- **Dispersion**:
  - Range: Max - Min
  - Quantiles: Data divided into equal portions
- **Application**:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Feature scaling
  - Outlier detection in vector spaces
