# 1. Introduction to EJS

## What is EJS?
EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. It is commonly used with Node.js and Express.js to create dynamic web pages.

## Why use EJS over plain HTML?
- **Dynamic Content**: EJS allows you to embed JavaScript code directly into your HTML, making it easy to render dynamic content.
- **Reusability**: You can create reusable components like headers, footers, and layouts.
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with Express.js and other Node.js frameworks.

## Difference between EJS and other templating engines
- **EJS vs Pug**: EJS uses regular HTML syntax, while Pug uses an indentation-based syntax.
- **EJS vs Handlebars**: EJS provides more flexibility with JavaScript logic, while Handlebars focuses on simplicity and logic-less templates.
