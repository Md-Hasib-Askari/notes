## üü¢ **Beginner Level: Core NestJS Concepts**

### ‚úÖ 1. Introduction to NestJS

* What is NestJS and why use it?
* Comparison with Express
* Installation & basic project setup

**Exercise**: Create a simple ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù NestJS app.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Modules, Controllers, and Providers

* Structure of a NestJS app
* Creating and using modules
* Controllers for handling routes
* Providers for dependency injection

**Exercise**: Build a basic CRUD blog with separate controller and service.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Dependency Injection (DI)

* What is DI?
* Using `@Injectable`, `@Inject`, and constructor injection
* Using custom providers

**Exercise**: Create a service that injects another service to return processed data.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Routing and Request Handling

* Routing with controllers
* Handling different HTTP methods
* Route parameters and query strings

**Exercise**: Add pagination and filtering routes to your CRUD blog.

---

## üü° **Intermediate Level: Core Features and Patterns**

### ‚úÖ 5. Data Persistence with TypeORM / Prisma / Mongoose

* Connecting to a database
* Repositories and Entities
* Database migrations (TypeORM)
* DTOs and data validation with `class-validator`

**Exercise**: Connect PostgreSQL and create a Todo app with full DB support.

---

### ‚úÖ 6. Middleware, Pipes, Guards, and Interceptors

* Middleware for request manipulation
* Pipes for validation and transformation
* Guards for authentication/authorization
* Interceptors for logging, caching, etc.

**Exercise**: Implement a request logger and a role-based guard.

---

### ‚úÖ 7. Configuration and Environment Variables

* Using `@nestjs/config`
* Loading and validating `.env` variables
* Environment-specific config

**Exercise**: Configure dev and prod environments with different settings.

---

### ‚úÖ 8. Error Handling & Exception Filters

* Global vs. scoped exception filters
* Custom exceptions
* Handling common HTTP errors

**Exercise**: Create a custom exception for "Resource Not Found".

---

### ‚úÖ 9. Authentication with Passport

* Local and JWT strategies
* Guards and Sessions
* Refresh Tokens (optional)

**Exercise**: Implement secure login/register with JWT.

---

## üîµ **Advanced Level: Architecture and Enterprise Features**

### ‚úÖ 10. Modular Architecture and Microservices

* Dynamic modules
* Shared modules and feature modules
* Intro to Microservices (TCP, Redis, NATS)

**Exercise**: Modularize a large project and create one microservice (e.g., notification service).

---

### ‚úÖ 11. GraphQL with NestJS

* GraphQL vs REST
* Schemas, resolvers, decorators
* Apollo server integration

**Exercise**: Convert an existing REST module to GraphQL.

---

### ‚úÖ 12. WebSockets with Gateway

* Real-time communication with `@WebSocketGateway`
* Events and message handling
* Integration with services

**Exercise**: Create a real-time chat or notification system.

---

### ‚úÖ 13. Task Scheduling and Queues

* Using `@nestjs/schedule`
* Adding job queues with Bull or RabbitMQ

**Exercise**: Create a job queue for sending emails after registration.

---

### ‚úÖ 14. Testing in NestJS

* Unit testing services and controllers
* E2E testing with `SuperTest`
* Mocking dependencies

**Exercise**: Write full unit and E2E tests for your Todo or Auth module.

---

## üü£ **Expert Level: Performance, DevOps & Deployment**

### ‚úÖ 15. Performance Optimization

* Caching strategies (Redis)
* Lazy loading modules
* Avoiding memory leaks and slow dependencies

**Exercise**: Implement caching in a high-read route (e.g., product search).

---

### ‚úÖ 16. Logging and Monitoring

* Using `winston`, `pino`, or `nestjs-pino`
* Application metrics
* Integrating with tools like Prometheus or Sentry

**Exercise**: Log all failed requests with timestamps and error stack.

---

### ‚úÖ 17. CI/CD and Dockerization

* Writing Dockerfiles and docker-compose
* Setting up CI pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
* Deploying to cloud (Heroku, Vercel, AWS)

**Exercise**: Containerize your NestJS app and deploy it.

---

### ‚úÖ 18. Custom Libraries and Monorepo (Nx)

* Creating reusable libraries
* Managing multiple apps with Nx monorepo

**Exercise**: Create a shared auth library and use it in two different NestJS services.

---

### ‚úÖ 19. Advanced Patterns & Domain-Driven Design

* CQRS pattern with `@nestjs/cqrs`
* Event sourcing
* Domain modeling

**Exercise**: Refactor a business-critical module using CQRS and DDD.

---

## üß† Final Project Ideas (Capstone)

* CRM backend with multi-role permissions
* Real-time stock tracking app with WebSocket + REST + Auth
* Microservice-based e-commerce backend (Auth, Product, Order, Payment services)
