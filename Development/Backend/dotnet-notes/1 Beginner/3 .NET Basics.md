# .NET Basics (Beginner Notes)

## 1. .NET Framework vs .NET Core vs .NET 5/6+

* **.NET Framework**:

  * Windows-only, older, not cross-platform.
  * Used for legacy desktop apps and web apps (ASP.NET Web Forms, WPF, WinForms).
* **.NET Core**:

  * Open-source, cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS).
  * Lightweight, modular, higher performance.
  * Introduced modern ASP.NET Core.
* **.NET 5/6+**:

  * Unified platform combining .NET Framework and .NET Core.
  * Cross-platform, long-term support (LTS versions).
  * Supports desktop, mobile, cloud, web, and IoT apps.

## 2. CLR, Assemblies, Namespaces

* **CLR (Common Language Runtime)**:

  * Execution engine for .NET.
  * Handles memory management, garbage collection, type safety, and security.
* **Assemblies**:

  * Compiled code (.exe or .dll).
  * Contains metadata (types, resources, manifest).
  * Can be private (local app folder) or shared (GAC).
* **Namespaces**:

  * Logical grouping of classes and types.
  * Helps organize large codebases and prevent naming conflicts.

  ```csharp
  namespace MyApp.Utilities
  {
      class Helper { }
  }
  ```

## 3. Project Structure in Visual Studio / VS Code

* Typical .NET project includes:

  * **Program.cs**: Entry point (`Main` method).
  * **Startup.cs** (for ASP.NET Core): Configures services and middleware.
  * **appsettings.json**: App configuration.
  * **Dependencies**: NuGet packages and framework libraries.
  * **Properties**: Project settings.
* **VS Code**: Lightweight editor with C# extension (OmniSharp).
* **Visual Studio**: Full IDE with designers, templates, debugging tools.

## 4. Debugging Basics

* **Breakpoints**: Pause execution at specific lines.
* **Step Over/Into/Out**: Control flow during debugging.
* **Watch & Locals Window**: Inspect variables and expressions.
* **Call Stack**: Trace method calls.
* **Logging**: Use `Console.WriteLine()` or logging libraries for runtime inspection.
* **Exception Handling**: Catch and handle runtime errors gracefully.
