# What is GraphQL?

## Core Concept
GraphQL is a **query language and runtime for APIs** developed by Facebook in 2012. Unlike traditional REST APIs that expose multiple endpoints, GraphQL provides a single endpoint where clients can request exactly the data they need.

## Key Benefits

### 1. Request Exactly What You Need
- **No Over-fetching**: Get only the fields you request
- **No Under-fetching**: Combine multiple resources in one query
- **Example**: Request only `name` and `email` from a user, not the entire object

### 2. Single Endpoint
- One URL handles all operations: `/graphql`
- Simplifies API versioning and maintenance
- Reduces complexity compared to multiple REST endpoints

### 3. Strong Type System
- Schema defines exact structure and types
- Compile-time validation
- Better tooling and IDE support
- Self-documenting APIs

### 4. Real-time Subscriptions
- Built-in support for live data updates
- WebSocket-based communication
- Perfect for chat apps, live feeds, notifications

## GraphQL vs REST

| GraphQL | REST |
|---------|------|
| Single endpoint | Multiple endpoints |
| Flexible queries | Fixed response structure |
| Strong typing | Loose contracts |
| Real-time subscriptions | Polling required |
| Learning curve | Familiar HTTP methods |

**When to use GraphQL**: Complex data requirements, mobile apps, rapid frontend development, real-time features.

**When to use REST**: Simple CRUD operations, caching requirements, team familiarity, file uploads.
