# Phase 2 – Kotlin & Android Native Basics (Weeks 7–8)

Goal: Learn enough Kotlin and Android to integrate native modules with React Native later.

What you’ll cover
- Kotlin language essentials (syntax, OOP, null safety)
- Android app structure and Activity lifecycle
- UI with XML layouts and ViewBinding
- Intents: explicit, implicit, and passing results
- Practice: Simple Calculator app in Kotlin

Navigation
- 01 Kotlin Basics → ./01%20Kotlin%20Basics.md

- 04 Intents and Navigation → ./04%20Intents%20and%20Navigation.md
- 05 Practice – Simple Calculator → ./05%20Practice%20-%20Simple%20Calculator.md

Suggested pacing
- Week 7: Kotlin Basics + Lifecycle
- Week 8: XML UI + Intents + Practice app

Prerequisites
- Android Studio installed, AVD configured, Kotlin selected as language when creating projects.
