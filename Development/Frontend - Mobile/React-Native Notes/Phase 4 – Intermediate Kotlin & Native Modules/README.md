# Phase 4 – Intermediate Kotlin & Native Modules (Weeks 15–16)

Goal: Connect React Native with native Kotlin while leveling up Android skills.

What you’ll cover
- Kotlin Advanced Android: RecyclerView, SharedPreferences & Room, Retrofit, WorkManager
- React Native + Native: Create Kotlin native modules, pass data both ways
- Practice: Notes App in Kotlin (Room) + expose a small native feature to RN

Navigation
- 01 RecyclerView & Adapters → ./01%20RecyclerView%20and%20Adapters.md
- 02 SharedPreferences & Room DB → ./02%20SharedPreferences%20and%20Room%20DB.md
- 03 Retrofit for REST APIs → ./03%20Retrofit%20for%20REST%20APIs.md
- 04 WorkManager Background Tasks → ./04%20WorkManager%20Background%20Tasks.md
- 05 React Native Native Modules (Kotlin) → ./05%20React%20Native%20Native%20Modules%20(Kotlin).md
- 06 Passing Data RN ↔ Native → ./06%20Passing%20Data%20RN%20and%20Native.md
- 07 Practice – Notes App (+ RN bridge) → ./07%20Practice%20-%20Notes%20App.md

Suggested pacing
- Week 15: RecyclerView + Room + Retrofit
- Week 16: WorkManager + RN native module + Practice integration

Prerequisites
- Android Studio set up; React Native bare project available for module integration.
