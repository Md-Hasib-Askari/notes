# Phase 1 – Core React Native Foundation (Weeks 3–6)

Goal: Create basic React Native apps, understand navigation, and think mobile-first.

What you’ll cover
- Setup: Tooling, RN CLI vs Expo, Android emulator, folder structure
- Core Components: View, Text, Image, ScrollView, FlatList, inputs & touchables
- Styling: StyleSheet, Flexbox, responsive techniques
- Navigation: React Navigation (Stack, Tabs, Drawer), passing params
- State Management (Basics): useState, useEffect, Context API
- Basic APIs: fetch/Axios, permissions, image picker, location
- Practice: Weather App (API calls, navigation, location)

Navigation
- 01 Setup → ./01%20Setup.md
- 02 Core Components → ./02%20Core%20Components.md
- 03 Styling → ./03%20Styling.md
- 04 Navigation (React Navigation) → ./04%20Navigation%20(React%20Navigation).md
- 05 State Management (Basics) → ./05%20State%20Management%20Basics.md
- 06 Basic APIs → ./06%20Basic%20APIs.md
- 07 Practice – Weather App → ./07%20Practice%20-%20Weather%20App.md

Suggested pacing
- Week 3: Setup + Core Components
- Week 4: Styling + Navigation
- Week 5: State + Basic APIs
- Week 6: Weather App

Prerequisites
- Comfortable with JS (ES6+) and basic React hooks (useState, useEffect).
