# Phase 3 – Intermediate React Native (Weeks 9–14)

Goal: Build production-like apps with state management, offline storage, and device features.

What you’ll cover
- State Management: Redux Toolkit or Zustand; when to choose global vs local
- Forms & Validation: react-hook-form + Yup
- Data Storage: AsyncStorage, SQLite / Realm / WatermelonDB
- Advanced Navigation: Deep linking, params, state persistence
- Push Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging (and Expo alternative)
- Device APIs: File system, advanced permissions, background tasks
- Practice: Expense Tracker (Redux, offline mode, push notifications)

Navigation
- 01 State Management → ./01%20State%20Management.md
- 02 Forms and Validation → ./02%20Forms%20and%20Validation.md
- 03 Data Storage → ./03%20Data%20Storage.md
- 04 Advanced Navigation → ./04%20Advanced%20Navigation.md
- 05 Push Notifications → ./05%20Push%20Notifications.md
- 06 Device APIs → ./06%20Device%20APIs.md
- 07 Practice – Expense Tracker → ./07%20Practice%20-%20Expense%20Tracker.md

Suggested pacing
- Week 9–10: State + Forms
- Week 11: Data Storage
- Week 12: Advanced Navigation
- Week 13: Notifications + Device APIs
- Week 14: Practice app

Prerequisites
