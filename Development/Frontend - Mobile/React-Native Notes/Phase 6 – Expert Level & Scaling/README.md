# Phase 6 – Expert Level & Scaling (Ongoing)

Goal: Develop enterprise-level skills and specialization.

What you’ll cover
- TypeScript in React Native
- Modular architecture and bundle strategy
- CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Bitrise, EAS)
- Deep linking and universal links
- Integrating ML models (TensorFlow.js, ML Kit)
- Advanced performance profiling with Flipper/Hermes
- White-label app frameworks
- Open-source contributions
- Final Challenge
