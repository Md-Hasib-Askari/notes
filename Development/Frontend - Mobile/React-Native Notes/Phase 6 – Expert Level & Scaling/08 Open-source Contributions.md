# Open-source Contributions

How to start
- Pick small issues (good-first-issue) in RN ecosystem repos (libraries you already use)
- Reproduce bugs and add failing tests first

Repo hygiene (for your projects)
- LICENSE (MIT/Apache-2.0)
- CONTRIBUTING.md with setup and PR steps
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- Issue and PR templates
- Conventional Commits + CHANGELOG (semantic-release)

PR etiquette
- Keep changes focused and documented
- Add tests and update docs
- Be responsive to maintainer feedback

Sustainability
- Use funding.yml for GitHub Sponsors (if maintaining)
- Automate CI checks and release flows
