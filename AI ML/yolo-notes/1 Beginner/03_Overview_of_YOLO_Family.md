# Overview of YOLO Family (v1 to v9)

## Introduction

YOLO (You Only Look Once) represents a paradigm shift in object detection, introducing the concept of single-shot detection that processes the entire image in one forward pass. Since its inception in 2015, the YOLO family has evolved through multiple versions, each bringing significant improvements in speed, accuracy, and architectural innovations.
