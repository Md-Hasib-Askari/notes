# Projects: Fine-tune YOLO, Real-time Detection, Model Conversion

## Project 1: Fine-tune YOLO on Traffic Sign Dataset

### Project Overview
This project demonstrates advanced fine-tuning techniques by adapting a pre-trained YOLO model to detect traffic signs. Traffic sign detection presents unique challenges including small object sizes, varying lighting conditions, weather effects, and the need for high precision in safety-critical applications.

### Dataset Preparation and Analysis
Begin with comprehensive dataset analysis using the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) or similar datasets. Analyze class distribution to identify imbalanced classes, examine object size distributions to understand scale challenges, and assess image quality variations across different weather and lighting conditions.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
from collections import Counter

def analyze_traffic_sign_dataset(dataset_path):
    # Load annotations and analyze distribution
    annotations = load_yolo_annotations(dataset_path)
    
    # Class distribution analysis
    class_counts = Counter([ann['class'] for ann in annotations])
    plt.figure(figsize=(15, 6))
    plt.bar(class_counts.keys(), class_counts.values())
    plt.title('Traffic Sign Class Distribution')
    plt.xticks(rotation=45)
    plt.show()
    
    # Object size analysis
    sizes = [ann['width'] * ann['height'] for ann in annotations]
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.hist(sizes, bins=50)
    plt.title('Object Size Distribution')
    plt.xlabel('Relative Object Size')
    plt.ylabel('Frequency')
    plt.show()
    
    return class_counts, sizes
```

### Advanced Fine-tuning Strategy
Implement sophisticated fine-tuning approaches including progressive unfreezing where backbone layers are gradually unfrozen during training, discriminative learning rates with different rates for different network layers, and class-weighted loss functions to handle imbalanced traffic sign categories.

### Domain-Specific Augmentations
Design augmentation strategies specific to traffic sign detection including weather simulation (rain, fog, snow effects), lighting variations (day, night, backlighting), perspective transformations (various viewing angles), and occlusion simulation (partial sign visibility).

### Evaluation and Validation
Implement comprehensive evaluation including per-class performance analysis, size-based performance evaluation, and real-world testing scenarios. Use specialized metrics for safety-critical applications including worst-case performance analysis and failure mode identification.

## Project 2: Real-time Webcam Object Detection

### System Architecture Design
Develop a robust real-time detection system that balances accuracy, speed, and resource utilization. The architecture includes optimized video capture using threading for non-blocking frame acquisition, efficient preprocessing pipelines with GPU acceleration, and smart frame dropping strategies during high load periods.

import cv2
import torch
import threading
from queue import Queue
import time

class RealTimeYOLODetector:
    def __init__(self, model_path, conf_threshold=0.5, device='cuda'):
        self.model = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'custom', 
                                   path=model_path, device=device)
        self.model.conf = conf_threshold
        self.frame_queue = Queue(maxsize=5)
        self.result_queue = Queue(maxsize=5)
        self.running = False
        
    def capture_frames(self, source=0):
        cap = cv2.VideoCapture(source)
        cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_BUFFERSIZE, 1)  # Reduce buffer size
        
        while self.running:
            ret, frame = cap.read()
            if ret:
                if not self.frame_queue.full():
                    self.frame_queue.put(frame)
                else:
                    # Drop oldest frame
                    try:
                        self.frame_queue.get_nowait()
                        self.frame_queue.put(frame)
                    except:
                        pass
                        
        cap.release()
    
    def process_frames(self):
        while self.running:
            if not self.frame_queue.empty():
                frame = self.frame_queue.get()
                results = self.model(frame)
                
                if not self.result_queue.full():
                    self.result_queue.put((frame, results))
                    
    def start_detection(self, source=0):
        self.running = True
        
        # Start threads
        capture_thread = threading.Thread(target=self.capture_frames, args=(source,))
        process_thread = threading.Thread(target=self.process_frames)
        
        capture_thread.start()
        process_thread.start()
        
        return capture_thread, process_thread
```

### Performance Optimization
Implement multiple optimization strategies including model quantization for reduced memory usage and faster inference, dynamic batching to process multiple frames simultaneously when possible, and adaptive resolution scaling based on computational load.

### User Interface Development
Create an intuitive user interface with real-time performance metrics (FPS, latency, CPU/GPU usage), configurable detection parameters (confidence threshold, NMS threshold), and visualization options (bounding boxes, class labels, confidence scores).

### Integration with External Systems
Develop integration capabilities with external systems including database logging of detection events, alert systems for specific object detections, and API endpoints for remote monitoring and control.

import onnx

class YOLOConverter:
    def __init__(self, model_path, input_shape=(1, 3, 640, 640)):
        self.model = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'custom', 
                                   path=model_path)
        self.model.eval()
        self.input_shape = input_shape
        
    def convert_to_onnx(self, output_path, opset_version=11):
        dummy_input = torch.randn(self.input_shape)
        
        torch.onnx.export(
            self.model,
            dummy_input,
            output_path,
            export_params=True,
            opset_version=opset_version,
            do_constant_folding=True,
            input_names=['input'],
            output_names=['output'],
            dynamic_axes={
                'input': {0: 'batch_size', 2: 'height', 3: 'width'},
                'output': {0: 'batch_size'}
            }
        )
        
        # Verify ONNX model
        onnx_model = onnx.load(output_path)
        onnx.checker.check_model(onnx_model)
        
    def convert_to_tensorrt(self, onnx_path, trt_path, precision='fp16'):
        logger = trt.Logger(trt.Logger.WARNING)
        builder = trt.Builder(logger)
        network = builder.create_network(1 << int(trt.NetworkDefinitionCreationFlag.EXPLICIT_BATCH))
        parser = trt.OnnxParser(network, logger)
        
        # Parse ONNX model
        with open(onnx_path, 'rb') as model:
            if not parser.parse(model.read()):
                for error in range(parser.num_errors):
                    print(parser.get_error(error))
                    
        # Configure builder
        config = builder.create_builder_config()
        config.max_workspace_size = 1 << 30  # 1GB
        
        if precision == 'fp16':
            config.set_flag(trt.BuilderFlag.FP16)
        elif precision == 'int8':
            config.set_flag(trt.BuilderFlag.INT8)
            
        # Build engine
        engine = builder.build_engine(network, config)
        
        # Save engine
        with open(trt_path, 'wb') as f:
            f.write(engine.serialize())
```
