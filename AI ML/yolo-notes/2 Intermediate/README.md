## 🔍 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Training Problems
```bash
# CUDA out of memory
# Solution: Reduce batch size or use gradient accumulation
python train.py --batch-size 8 --accumulate 4

# Slow training
# Solution: Optimize data loading
python train.py --workers 8 --cache ram

# Poor convergence
# Solution: Adjust learning rate and warm-up
python train.py --lr0 0.001 --warmup_epochs 5
```

#### Model Performance Issues
```python
# Low mAP scores
# Check data quality and augmentation settings
def diagnose_training(results_dir):
    # Analyze class distribution
    # Check augmentation effectiveness
    # Validate annotation quality
    pass

# Overfitting
# Increase regularization and validation frequency
model.train(
    data='dataset.yaml',
    epochs=100,
    dropout=0.1,
    weight_decay=0.001,
    val=True
)
```

#### Deployment Challenges
```python
# ONNX conversion errors
# Ensure compatible PyTorch and ONNX versions
pip install torch==1.13.0 onnx==1.12.0

# TensorRT optimization issues
# Use explicit batch sizes and fixed input shapes
model.export(format='engine', dynamic=False, simplify=True)
```

## 📈 Performance Monitoring

    wandb.init(project="yolo-production")
    
    # Custom callback for detailed logging
    def log_predictions(trainer):
        if trainer.epoch % 10 == 0:
            # Log sample predictions
            wandb.log({"predictions": trainer.plot_training_samples()})
