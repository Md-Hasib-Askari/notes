## üß© **1.3 Model Families and Licenses**

### üîπ **Open Weight Models**

**Definition:**
These are models whose **weights (parameters)** are publicly released. You can **download**, **fine-tune**, **self-host**, or **deploy** them locally or in your own infrastructure.

#### ‚úÖ Benefits:

* Full control and transparency
* Fine-tuning possible
* On-premise deployment (no internet dependency)
* Lower cost at scale
* Better for data privacy / compliance

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations:

* May require GPU resources to host
* Performance may lag behind proprietary models
* Licensing terms vary (commercial vs non-commercial)

#### üß† Examples of Open Weight Models:

| Model             | Base Model       | License                       |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| LLaMA 2 / LLaMA 3 | Meta             | Meta license (commercial use) |
| Mistral / Mixtral | Mistral AI       | Apache 2.0                    |
| Falcon            | TII UAE          | Apache 2.0                    |
| Phi-3             | Microsoft        | MIT license                   |
| OpenChat          | Open Source Devs | Varies (GPL/MIT)              |
| Gemma             | Google           | Commercial friendly           |

### üîí **Closed Weight Models**

**Definition:**
These models are **proprietary**‚Äîyou can **use** them via API, but **can‚Äôt access or modify** their internal weights. You rely on a **hosted service** to run the model.

#### ‚úÖ Benefits:

* State-of-the-art performance
* No need for powerful local hardware
* Constant updates and improvements

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations:

* API usage costs (token-based billing)
* Limited customization/fine-tuning
* Risk of rate limits and vendor lock-in
* Potential data privacy concerns

#### üîê Examples of Closed Weight Models:

| Model         | Provider  | Access Type       |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| GPT-4, GPT-4o | OpenAI    | API               |
| Claude 3      | Anthropic | API               |
| Gemini 1.5    | Google    | API (limited SDK) |
| Command R+    | Cohere    | API               |
| Jurassic-2    | AI21 Labs | API               |

### üß† Which One to Use?

| Scenario                           | Recommended Model Type      |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Need full control / self-hosting   | Open Weight Models          |
