### ‚úÖ **1.0 Transformer Models and LLMs**

#### üîπ What is a Transformer Model?

* A transformer is a deep learning architecture introduced in the paper **‚ÄúAttention is All You Need‚Äù (Vaswani et al., 2017)**.
* It uses **self-attention** mechanisms to process input sequences in parallel (unlike RNNs which process sequentially).
* Transformers are the foundation for modern LLMs (like GPT, BERT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).

#### üîπ Key Components of Transformer:

1. **Embedding Layer**
   Converts input tokens (words/subwords) into vector representations.

2. **Positional Encoding**
   Since transformers don't have recurrence, positional encoding injects sequence order information.

3. **Multi-Head Self-Attention**
   Helps the model focus on different parts of the input simultaneously.

4. **Feed-Forward Network (FFN)**
   Applies non-linear transformations to attention outputs.

5. **Layer Normalization + Residual Connections**
   Helps stabilize training and gradient flow.

#### üîπ LLM (Large Language Model)

* An LLM is a transformer trained on massive text data to predict the next token.
* Examples:

  * GPT-4, Claude, Gemini (chat-based)
  * BERT, RoBERTa (encoder-only)
  * T5, FLAN-T5 (encoder-decoder)
