## ✅ 7.4 **Evaluation and Testing**

Building an agent is only half the job — making sure it works **reliably, accurately, and safely** is critical. Evaluation ensures your AI agent behaves as intended, even under edge cases or unexpected inputs.

### 🔹 **1. Metrics to Track**

Start by defining **key metrics** based on your use case:

| Category             | Example Metrics                              | Purpose                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 🔍 Accuracy          | Correctness, Factual Score, Relevance        | Measures answer validity     |
| 🧠 Reasoning Quality | Coherence, Logical Consistency, Completeness | Checks depth and rationality |
| 🔁 Response Quality  | Grammar, Fluency, Style, Format              | Human-likeness & polish      |
| 💬 Response Time     | Latency, Token Count, API Duration           | UX performance               |
| ⚙️ Tool Success Rate | Tool Call Failures / Total Tool Calls        | Tool integration reliability |
| 🧪 Pass Rate         | How often the agent completes the task       | Macro-performance check      |

> Use frameworks like **LangSmith**, **Ragas**, or **DeepEval** for tracking these in pipelines.

### 🔹 **2. Unit Testing for Individual Tools**

Every external tool (e.g., search, code exec, DB) should be **tested in isolation**.

#### 🧪 Why?

* Prevent cascading failures
* Catch malformed inputs or schema errors
* Ensure graceful error handling

#### ✅ How:

* Write tests for each function’s I/O schema
* Simulate edge cases (e.g., invalid user query, timeout)
* Use mocking libraries to test without real API calls

```python
def test_search_tool_invalid_query():
    result = search_tool(" ")
    assert "error" in result
```

---

### 🔹 **3. Integration Testing for Flows**

This ensures that the entire **agent loop**, from input to tool invocation to final output, functions as expected.

#### 🧠 Things to Test:

* Prompt formatting
* Function calling logic
* Multi-turn consistency
* Memory retrieval accuracy

#### 🛠 Tools:

* `pytest` with scenario-based prompts
* LangChain’s built-in `evaluate_chain()`
* Custom script to run test prompts and assert outputs

```python
assert "weather" in agent.run("What’s the temperature in Tokyo?")
```

---

### 🔹 **4. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Evaluation**

For subjective tasks (e.g., summarization, writing), human feedback is essential.

#### Techniques:

* Ask humans to **rate agent responses**: 1–5 for relevance, accuracy, tone
* Use **A/B comparisons** (e.g., original vs. improved prompt)
* Conduct **blind evaluations** to reduce bias

#### Tooling Support:

* [OpenAI Evals](https://github.com/openai/evals)
* [Ragas](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas) for RAG tasks
* Spreadsheet-based or custom UIs for rating samples

---

### ⚠️ Best Practices

* Use **sandboxed environments** for testing tools that can write to file systems or execute code
* Define **error boundaries** and retry logic in test cases
* Automate evaluation as part of CI/CD for production agents

### ✅ Summary

| Evaluation Type     | Purpose                            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Unit Testing        | Tool correctness & reliability     |
| Integration Testing | Agent workflow and logic integrity |
| Human Feedback      | Subjective quality & UX evaluation |
| Metrics Monitoring  | Ongoing agent performance insights |

> Good testing = safer, smarter, and more stable agents.
