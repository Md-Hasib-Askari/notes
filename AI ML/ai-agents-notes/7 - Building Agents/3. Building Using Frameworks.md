## 🛠️ 7.3 **Building Using Frameworks**

Frameworks abstract away the **boilerplate, orchestration, and memory management**, so you can focus on logic and capabilities. They help with:

* Tool integration
* Agent loops
* Memory (short + long-term)
* Evaluation
* Chaining multiple agents

Let’s look at the most popular agent-building frameworks:

---

### 🔹 **1. LangChain**

One of the most widely used frameworks for LLM applications.

#### ⭐ Core Concepts:

* **Chains**: sequences of LLM calls (e.g., prompt → LLM → output parser)
* **Agents**: decision-making loop + tool calling
* **Tools**: modular external functions
* **Memory**: context storage (chat history, vector DBs)

#### 🧠 Built-in Support:

* LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace, etc.)
* Tools (Python REPL, web search, APIs)
* Vector stores (Pinecone, Chroma, Weaviate)

#### 🔧 Example:

```python
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent
agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent_type="zero-shot-react-description")
response = agent.run("Search the current weather in Dhaka")
```

> LangChain is highly flexible but can become **complex** for larger setups.

### 🔹 **2. LlamaIndex** (formerly GPT Index)

Originally built for **document Q\&A and RAG**, but now supports **agentic workflows**.

#### ✅ Best For:

* RAG agents
* Indexing and retrieval
* Graph-based agent workflows

#### Core Features:

* **ServiceContext**: encapsulates LLM, prompt, and memory
* **StorageContext**: handles vector DBs
* **Agents**: `OpenAIAgent`, `QueryEngineTool`

#### 🧠 Use Case:

```python
agent = OpenAIAgent.from_tools([query_engine_tool])
response = agent.chat("Summarize the last 3 meeting notes.")
```

> Combines well with LangChain and supports function calling + retrieval.

---

### 🔹 **3. Haystack (deepset.ai)**

An open-source NLP framework, mostly known for **search and RAG**, but recently evolved to support **agents and pipelines**.

#### Highlights:

* Modular pipelines
* Elasticsearch integration
* REST API for deployment
* Agents (LLM Tools + Orchestration)

> Best for **enterprise document search** and **QA agents** with open-source flexibility.

---

### 🔹 **4. AutoGen (Microsoft)**

A powerful framework to build **multi-agent** conversations.

#### 🧠 Key Concepts:

* **Agents** as Python classes with goals
* **GroupChat** to coordinate agents
* **Tool agents** can call APIs, databases, or Python functions

#### Example Use Case:

* **UserProxyAgent** interacts with you
* **AssistantAgent** generates answers
* **CodeAgent** executes Python code
* All collaborate in a GroupChat

> Ideal for **multi-agent research**, collaboration, and planning workflows.

---

### 🔹 **5. CrewAI**

Framework for **collaborative agents** working as a team with assigned roles.

#### Key Concepts:

* Agents with **roles, goals, tools**
* A **task queue** and execution planner
* Inter-agent communication

#### Example:

* Role: “Research Analyst”
* Goal: “Find academic papers on climate change”
* Tool: `arxiv_search()`

**Benefits:**

* Human-like division of labor
* Good for automation pipelines and creative workflows

---

### 🔹 **6. Smol Depot** 🧪

An experimental ecosystem for creating **minimalist autonomous agents**. Built on the philosophy of small, composable, hackable agents.

#### Use Cases:

* Agents that build code
* Agents that build agents
* Bootstrapped assistants

#### Tools:

* `smol-developer`: generate repo scaffolding
* `smol-prompt`: minimal prompt templates

> Great for experimental, recursive, and educational agents.

| Framework  | Best For                     | Strengths                              |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| LangChain  | General-purpose agents + RAG | Rich ecosystem, lots of tools          |
| LlamaIndex | Retrieval + data agents      | Great RAG abstraction                  |
| Haystack   | Enterprise Q\&A + pipelines  | Document pipelines, Elasticsearch      |
| AutoGen    | Multi-agent systems          | Coordination + reasoning agents        |
| CrewAI     | Role-based collaboration     | Modular agent design, real-world flows |
| Smol Depot | Experimental agent dev       | Minimalist, creative, recursive agents |
