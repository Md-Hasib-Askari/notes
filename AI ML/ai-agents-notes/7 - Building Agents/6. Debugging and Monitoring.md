## ✅ 7.6 Debugging and Monitoring

### 🔹 Structured Logging & Tracing

Structured logging and tracing allow developers to **understand, debug, and audit agent behavior**, especially in multi-step workflows with tool use or memory.

---

### 🧱 **What is Structured Logging?**

Structured logs are **machine-readable logs** (e.g., JSON) that capture:

| Field          | Description                               |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Timestamp      | When the event happened                   |
| Level          | `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`       |
| Event Name     | `tool_invocation`, `model_response`, etc. |
| Input / Output | What was received/sent                    |
| Metadata       | User ID, session ID, token usage, latency |

✅ Use structured logging to:

* Debug failed tool calls
* Analyze response times
* Trace hallucination sources

```python
import logging, json

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def log_event(event_name, data):
    logging.info(json.dumps({"event": event_name, **data}))
```

### 🧭 **What is Tracing?**

Tracing logs the **sequence of steps** taken during an agent run — from user input → reasoning → tool invocation → final output.

**Tracing shows:**

* Flow of decision-making
* Tool call success/failure
* Prompt evolution across agent turns

> Most frameworks (LangChain, AutoGen) support tracing hooks or middleware.

## ✅ 7.7 Observability Tools

These tools provide dashboards, tracing, and analytics for LLM apps:

---

### 🔸 1. **LangSmith** (by LangChain)

* ✅ Use for: Prompt versioning, step-by-step traces, model/tool error tracking
* Visual graph of agent reasoning and calls
* Tracks token usage and model latency
* Evaluates prompt versions with built-in scoring

📌 Works well for **LangChain** and **OpenAI API** users

### 🔸 2. **Helicone**

> A drop-in observability tool for OpenAI API usage

* ✅ Use for: API request logging, usage dashboards, cost tracking
* Works by **proxying OpenAI API calls**
* Log prompts, responses, latencies, and user/session metadata
* Integrate with SQL or dashboards

🔧 Setup Example:

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <OPENAI_KEY>" \
  -H "Helicone-Auth: Bearer <HELICONE_API_KEY>"
```

### 🔸 3. **LangFuse**

> End-to-end observability platform for LLM workflows

* ✅ Use for: Complex agent chains and production-grade tracing
* Offers **event-based tracing** like backend APM tools
* Tracks evaluation results, model decisions, tool usage
* Integrates with **LangChain, OpenAI, FastAPI**, etc.

🧪 Features:

* Compare prompts and retries
* See conversation history with memory replay
* Real-time error & latency insights

### 🔸 4. **openllmetry**

> A community project to standardize **LLM observability** using OpenTelemetry principles

* ✅ Use for: Open, vendor-agnostic monitoring
* Brings **structured logging**, **traces**, and **metrics** to LLM agents
* Export data to **Grafana, Prometheus, Datadog, etc.**
* Ideal for enterprise-scale production agents

### ✅ Summary

| Tool            | Best For                  | Notes                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **LangSmith**   | LangChain tracing, eval   | Visual, integrated with LangChain        |
| **Helicone**    | API usage + cost tracking | Lightweight, proxy-based                 |
| **LangFuse**    | Full observability        | Great for debugging + eval + UX tracking |
| **openllmetry** | Custom & scalable logging | Open standard, export anywhere           |

---

### 🛠 Best Practices

* Always log **inputs, outputs, and errors**
* Use **unique trace/session IDs**
* Add alerts for failures, long latencies, or hallucinations
* Pair logs with **evaluation scores** (LangSmith, LangFuse)
