## 🧠 **5. Agent Memory**


### 🔹 **5.1 What is Agent Memory?**

**Agent Memory** refers to the ability of an AI agent to **retain, retrieve, and update information** across interactions or sessions. It enables:

* Personalization
* Task continuity
* Contextual understanding
* Reflection and learning

Without memory, an LLM is stateless — it can’t “remember” anything beyond the current prompt window.

### 🔹 **5.2 Short Term Memory**

**Short-Term Memory (STM)** exists **within the prompt** — it's everything the model sees during a single inference.

#### 📌 Characteristics:

* **Transient**: Only exists for one interaction
* **Token-limited**: Bound by context window size (e.g., 8k, 32k tokens)
* **Used for**:

  * Recent dialogue turns
  * Intermediate steps in reasoning
  * Tool responses

Example in prompt:

```text
User: What's the capital of France?
Assistant: Paris.
User: What's the population of that city?
```

The agent uses STM to connect "that city" → Paris.

### 🔹 **5.3 Long Term Memory**

**Long-Term Memory (LTM)** refers to **persistent, retrievable memory** that survives across sessions.

#### 💾 Implementations:

* **Vector DBs (e.g., Chroma, Pinecone, FAISS):**
  Store text chunks as embeddings for similarity search.

* **SQL/NoSQL Databases:**
  Structured memory like user preferences, chat history, task metadata.

* **Custom Solutions:**
  JSON files, object storage, memory graphs, etc.

#### Use Cases:

* Recalling user preferences or prior conversations
* Maintaining facts across tasks
* Saving task outputs for future use

### 🔹 **5.4 Episodic vs Semantic Memory**

Understanding the two types of memory used in agents:

#### 🧠 **Episodic Memory**

* Stores specific events or interactions.
* Examples: “User asked about LLM pricing on June 1st.”

#### 📚 **Semantic Memory**

* Stores generalized knowledge or facts.
* Examples: “User prefers code in Python” or “Dhaka is in Bangladesh.”

> Agents may use both types for intelligent behavior: episodic for context, semantic for personalization.

### 🔹 **5.5 Maintaining Memory**

Proper memory management is crucial for agent reliability and efficiency.

---

#### ✅ **RAG and Vector Databases**

* RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) uses embedding search to fetch relevant memories or documents and include them in the prompt.

---

#### ✅ **User Profile Storage**

* Store static and dynamic preferences:

  * Name, language
  * Preferred tools, tone, schedule, etc.

---

#### ✅ **Summarization / Compression**

* To overcome context window limits:

  * Summarize chat history
  * Condense long documents or tool outputs

> “Summarized memory” is often stored in vector DBs to reduce token use.

---

#### ✅ **Forgetting / Aging Strategies**

* Keep memory clean and current:

  * Expire outdated memories
  * Reduce vector weights of old interactions
  * Selectively delete based on usage
