## üèóÔ∏è **6. Agent Architectures**

---

### üîπ **6.1 Common Architectures**

These foundational structures are widely used in real-world AI agents and open-source frameworks.

---

#### üß† **1. ReAct (Reason + Act)**

> üìò Paper: *‚ÄúReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models‚Äù*

**Workflow:**

1. **Reason**: The LLM explains its thinking step-by-step.
2. **Act**: Based on reasoning, it invokes a tool or performs an action.
3. **Observe**: The tool result is reflected upon.
4. Repeat‚Ä¶

**Example:**

```text
Thought: I need to search for the weather.
Action: search_web("weather in Dhaka")
Observation: It's 32¬∞C and sunny.
Thought: Now I can answer.
Answer: It's sunny and 32¬∞C in Dhaka.
```

**Benefits:**

* Transparent reasoning
* Easy debugging
* Supports tool use + planning

---

#### üß† **2. Chain of Thought (CoT)**

> üìò Paper: *‚ÄúChain of Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in LLMs‚Äù*

**Idea:** Let the LLM reason step-by-step in natural language **before** giving the final answer.

**Prompt Example:**

```text
Q: If Alice has 3 apples and Bob gives her 2 more, how many does she have?
A: First, Alice has 3 apples. Bob gives her 2 more. 3 + 2 = 5. So, the answer is 5.
```

**Use Case:**

* Arithmetic, logic, symbolic tasks
* Encourages better intermediate reasoning

**Limitation:**

* No tool use ‚Äî only internal reasoning.

---

#### ü§ñ **3. RAG Agent (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**

**Architecture:**

* LLM + Vector Store + Retriever

**Flow:**

1. Convert query to embedding
2. Search relevant docs from vector DB
3. Inject into prompt
4. LLM generates based on retrieved knowledge

**Use Case:**

* Domain-specific Q\&A
* Open-book agents

**Advantages:**

* Access to external knowledge
* Avoids hallucination

---

### üîπ **6.2 Other Architecture Patterns**

Now let‚Äôs explore more **advanced or specialized patterns** beyond the core three.

---

#### ‚öôÔ∏è **1. Planner-Executor Pattern**

**Separation of Roles:**

* **Planner Agent:** Creates a step-by-step plan or sub-tasks.
* **Executor Agent:** Performs actions for each step.

**Useful For:**

* Complex workflows
* Task decomposition
* Multi-agent collaboration

---

#### üîÅ **2. DAG Agents (Directed Acyclic Graph)**

**Concept:**

* Tasks are represented as nodes in a DAG
* Dependencies define execution order

**Use Case:**

* Data pipelines, sequential processing with dependencies

**Example:**
An ETL agent that:

1. Downloads file ‚Üí 2. Parses ‚Üí 3. Filters ‚Üí 4. Uploads to DB

---

#### üå≥ **3. Tree-of-Thought (ToT)**

> üìò Paper: *‚ÄúTree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with Language Models‚Äù*

**Structure:**

* LLM explores multiple reasoning paths (thought branches)
* Evaluates and chooses the best one

**Features:**

* Self-reflection + evaluation
* More robust problem-solving

**Example Use Case:**

* Game agents (e.g., puzzles), scientific problem solving, creative writing
