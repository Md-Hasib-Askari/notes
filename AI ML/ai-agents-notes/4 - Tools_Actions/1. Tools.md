## 🛠️ **4. Tools / Actions**

---

### 🔹 **4.1 Tool Definition**

A **Tool** (also called **Function**, **Action**, or **Capability**) is a predefined operation the agent can call to perform real-world or computational tasks.

Each tool should have a clear specification so that the agent knows *what it does*, *what input it needs*, and *what output it returns*.

---

#### ✅ **Name and Description**

* Should be intuitive and describe the tool’s purpose.

```json
{
  "name": "search_web",
  "description": "Performs a Google search and returns top 3 results"
}
```

---

#### ✅ **Input / Output Schema**

* Must be **well-defined** so the agent can use the tool correctly.

```json
{
  "input": {
    "query": "string"
  },
  "output": {
    "results": ["title": "string", "url": "string"]
  }
}
```

This structure helps LLMs call tools with proper JSON formatting (especially in OpenAI Function Calling or Langchain tools).

---

#### ✅ **Error Handling**

* Agents should gracefully handle:

  * Missing inputs
  * Network/API failures
  * Empty results

> You can use structured outputs like `{ "error": "Timeout while fetching data" }` or a fallback tool.

---

#### ✅ **Usage Examples**

* Include examples in the system prompt or tool spec.

```text
Example Call:
{
  "tool_name": "get_weather",
  "parameters": { "location": "Dhaka", "unit": "Celsius" }
}
```

### 🔹 **4.2 Examples of Tools**

Here are common categories of tools used by LLM agents:

---

#### 🌐 **Web Search**

* Perform live information retrieval
* Useful for up-to-date news, prices, facts

> Tools: SerpAPI, Tavily, Google Custom Search

---

#### 🧠 **Code Execution / REPL**

* Run Python/JavaScript code
* Enables computation, data analysis, plot generation

> Tools: PythonTool, Jupyter Kernel, ReAct Code Interpreter

---

#### 🗃️ **Database Queries**

* Connects to SQL/NoSQL databases
* Agent constructs queries to fetch/update structured data

> Example:

```json
{
  "tool": "query_db",
  "params": { "sql": "SELECT name FROM users WHERE age > 25" }
}
```

---

#### 🔗 **API Requests**

* Agents can call any REST API
* Pass headers, body, method, URL

> Useful for integrating with external systems like weather, finance, etc.

---

#### 📧 **Email / Slack / SMS**

* Send messages, alerts, or updates via communication platforms

> Example use case: daily summary agent sending Slack messages

---

#### 📂 **File System Access**

* Read/write local or cloud files
* Upload/download PDFs, images, CSVs, etc.

> Use with care — **permissioning and sandboxing** are key for security.

---

### ⚙️ Tool Use in Practice (Agent Context)

In agent frameworks (Langchain, AutoGen, CrewAI):

* Tools are registered during agent setup
* LLM is given a list of tools + input/output schemas
* When reasoning, the model **chooses** the right tool and **calls** it with appropriate input
