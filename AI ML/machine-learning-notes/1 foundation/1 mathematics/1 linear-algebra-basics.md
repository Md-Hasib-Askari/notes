# Linear Algebra Basics

## Overview
Linear algebra is the foundation of machine learning, providing the mathematical framework for understanding data transformations, model parameters, and optimization algorithms.

## Key Concepts

### Scalars, Vectors, and Matrices
- **Scalar**: A single number (0-dimensional)
- **Vector**: An array of numbers (1-dimensional)
- **Matrix**: A 2D array of numbers
- **Tensor**: Multi-dimensional arrays

### Basic Operations
- Matrix multiplication
- Element-wise operations
- Transpose operations
- Matrix inverses

### Applications in ML
- Data representation
- Feature transformations
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Neural network computations
