# Transformers

## Overview
Transformers are a neural network architecture that revolutionized natural language processing. They use self-attention mechanisms to process sequences in parallel, making them highly efficient and effective.

## Key Components
- **Self-Attention**: Allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Multiple attention mechanisms working in parallel
- **Positional Encoding**: Adds position information to input embeddings
- **Feed-Forward Networks**: Dense layers for processing attended features

## Architecture
```
Input → Embedding + Positional Encoding → 
Encoder Layers (Self-Attention + Feed-Forward) → 
Decoder Layers (Self-Attention + Cross-Attention + Feed-Forward) → 
Output
```

## Popular Models
- **BERT**: Bidirectional encoder for understanding tasks
- **GPT**: Generative pre-trained transformer for text generation
- **T5**: Text-to-text transfer transformer
- **RoBERTa**: Robustly optimized BERT approach

## Implementation Example
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
import torch

# Load pre-trained model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Tokenize and encode text
text = "Hello, how are you?"
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt')

# Get model outputs
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    embeddings = outputs.last_hidden_state

print(embeddings.shape)
```

## Advantages
- **Parallelization**: Processes all tokens simultaneously
- **Long-range Dependencies**: Captures relationships across entire sequences
- **Transfer Learning**: Pre-trained models work well on downstream tasks

## Applications
- **Text Classification**: Sentiment analysis, spam detection
- **Question Answering**: Reading comprehension tasks
- **Text Generation**: Creative writing, chatbots
- **Machine Translation**: Language-to-language conversion
- **Text Summarization**: Document summarization

## Best Practices
1. Use pre-trained models and fine-tune for specific tasks
2. Apply appropriate tokenization for your domain
3. Use attention visualization to understand model behavior
4. Consider computational requirements for large models
