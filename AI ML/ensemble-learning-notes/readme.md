### 4. **Simple Stacking**

* **Concept:** Combine outputs of multiple models using a meta-model.
* **Example:** Logistic regression on top of RandomForest + SVM.

### 7. **Advanced Stacking / Blending**

* **Nested cross-validation** for stacking
* **Blending vs Stacking:** Differences in data split usage.
* **Exercise:** Blend neural networks with tree models.
