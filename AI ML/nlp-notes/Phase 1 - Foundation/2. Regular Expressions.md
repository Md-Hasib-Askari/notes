# Regular Expressions for Text Processing

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful patterns used to match and manipulate text.

## Core Regex Concepts
- **Literals**: Match exact characters (e.g., `cat` matches "cat")
- **Metacharacters**: Special characters with specific meanings
  - `.` (any character), `^` (start), `$` (end)
  - `*` (0+ occurrences), `+` (1+ occurrences), `?` (0-1 occurrence)
  - `[]` (character class), `()` (grouping)
  - `\d` (digits), `\w` (word chars), `\s` (whitespace)

## NLP Applications
- **Text cleaning**: Remove unwanted characters, HTML tags
- **Pattern extraction**: Emails, dates, phone numbers, URLs
- **Tokenization**: Split text into meaningful units
- **Feature engineering**: Extract patterns for ML models

## Example Usage
```python
import re
# Extract all email addresses from text
emails = re.findall(r'[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+\.\w+', text)

# Remove HTML tags
clean_text = re.sub(r'<.*?>', '', html_text)
```

Regex is essential for NLP preprocessing but has limitations with complex linguistic patterns. Use specialized NLP libraries for advanced language analysis.
