# spaCy: Industrial-Strength NLP

spaCy is a modern Python library designed for production use in NLP applications, focusing on efficiency and ease of use.

## Key Features

### High-Performance Processing
- Written in Cython for speed and memory efficiency
- Optimized for CPU usage with multithreading support
- Pipeline architecture for efficient text processing

### Core Functionality
- **Tokenization**: Advanced rule-based tokenizer handling various languages
  ```python
  import spacy
  nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
  doc = nlp("spaCy offers industrial-strength NLP.")
  for token in doc:
      print(token.text, token.pos_, token.dep_)
  ```

- **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Statistical models for accurate POS assignment
- **Dependency Parsing**: Analyzing grammatical structure of sentences
  ```python
  # Visualize dependency tree
  from spacy import displacy
  displacy.render(doc, style="dep")
  ```

- **Named Entity Recognition**: Identifying and categorizing entities
  ```python
  doc = nlp("Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion")
  for ent in doc.ents:
      print(ent.text, ent.label_)  # "Apple" ORG, "U.K." GPE, "$1 billion" MONEY
  ```

### Advanced Features
- **Word Vectors**: Pre-trained embeddings for semantic similarity
  ```python
  doc1 = nlp("I like cats")
  doc2 = nlp("I love felines")
  similarity = doc1.similarity(doc2)  # Semantic similarity score
  ```

- **Text Classification**: Custom pipelines for categorization tasks
- **Rule-Based Matching**: Pattern matching with token attributes
  ```python
  from spacy.matcher import Matcher
  matcher = Matcher(nlp.vocab)
  pattern = [{"LOWER": "hello"}, {"IS_PUNCT": True}, {"LOWER": "world"}]
  matcher.add("HelloWorld", [pattern])
  matches = matcher(doc)
  ```

### Integration and Extensibility
- Custom pipeline components
- Integration with deep learning frameworks
- Support for multiple languages with trained models

## Advantages over NLTK
- Designed for production environments
- 5-10x faster processing speed
- Unified API with consistent object representation
- Better support for modern NLP workflows
- Smaller memory footprint

## Getting Started
```python
# Install core library and English model
# pip install spacy
# python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

import spacy

# Load model and process text
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp("spaCy is an industrial-strength NLP library built for production use.")

# Access linguistic annotations
for token in doc:
    print(f"{token.text}\t{token.pos_}\t{token.dep_}\t{token.head.text}")
```

spaCy excels in production environments where processing speed and memory efficiency are crucial, while providing state-of-the-art accuracy for core NLP tasks.
