# Basic Text Similarity Measures

Text similarity metrics quantify how similar two text documents or strings are to each other.

## Edit Distance Measures
- **Levenshtein Distance**: Minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) to change one string to another
- **Hamming Distance**: Number of positions where corresponding symbols differ (for equal-length strings)
- **Jaro-Winkler**: Similarity score considering character matches and transpositions, favoring strings that match from the beginning

## Token-Based Measures
- **Jaccard Similarity**: Intersection over union of token sets
  - J(A,B) = |A∩B| / |A∪B|
- **Dice Coefficient**: 2 × intersection over sum of sizes
  - Dice(A,B) = 2|A∩B| / (|A|+|B|)
- **Overlap Coefficient**: Intersection over size of smaller set
  - Overlap(A,B) = |A∩B| / min(|A|,|B|)

## Applications
- **Duplicate detection**: Finding identical or near-identical documents
- **Plagiarism detection**: Identifying copied content
- **Information retrieval**: Ranking search results by relevance
- **Spelling correction**: Suggesting similar words

These basic measures provide a foundation for more advanced semantic similarity techniques that consider meaning rather than just surface form.
