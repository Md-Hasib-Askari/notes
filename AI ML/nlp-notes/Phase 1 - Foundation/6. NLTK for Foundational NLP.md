# NLTK: Natural Language Toolkit

NLTK is a comprehensive Python library for natural language processing tasks, designed primarily for educational and research purposes.

## Core Features

### Text Processing
- **Tokenization**: Split text into words, sentences, or paragraphs
  ```python
  from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize
  words = word_tokenize("NLTK is a powerful toolkit for NLP.")
  sentences = sent_tokenize("NLTK is powerful. It supports many languages.")
  ```
- **Normalization**: Convert text to lowercase, remove punctuation
- **Stemming/Lemmatization**: Reduce words to their base forms
  ```python
  from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer, WordNetLemmatizer
  ps = PorterStemmer()
  ps.stem("running")  # Returns "run"
  
  wnl = WordNetLemmatizer()
  wnl.lemmatize("better", pos='a')  # Returns "good" with POS tag 'a' for adjective
  ```

### Linguistic Analysis
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Label words with grammatical categories
  ```python
  from nltk import pos_tag
  pos_tag(word_tokenize("NLTK analyzes text efficiently"))  # [('NLTK', 'NNP'), ('analyzes', 'VBZ'), ...]
  ```
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Identify entities like people, organizations
  ```python
  from nltk import ne_chunk
  ne_chunk(pos_tag(word_tokenize("Google is based in Mountain View")))
  ```
- **Parsing**: Generate syntax trees for sentences
  ```python
  from nltk.parse.chart import ChartParser
  parser = ChartParser(grammar)
  trees = parser.parse(tokens)
  ```

### Corpus Access
- Pre-processed text collections (Brown, Reuters, etc.)
- WordNet lexical database for semantic relationships
  ```python
  from nltk.corpus import wordnet
  synonyms = [syn.lemmas()[0].name() for syn in wordnet.synsets("good")]
  ```

### Text Classification
- Built-in classifiers for sentiment analysis, topic identification
- Support for Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and other algorithms

## Advantages
- Easy to install: `pip install nltk`
- Comprehensive documentation and extensive examples
- Large community support and educational resources
- Includes corpora and pre-trained models for immediate use
- Perfect for learning NLP concepts

## Limitations
- Slower than industrial-strength libraries like spaCy
- Not optimized for production environments
- Less support for deep learning integration

## Getting Started
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('popular')  # Download popular datasets and models

# Basic NLP pipeline
text = "NLTK is a wonderful library for learning NLP concepts."
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
pos_tags = pos_tag(tokens)
entities = ne_chunk(pos_tags)
```

NLTK remains essential for NLP learners due to its educational focus, comprehensive documentation, and vast functionality across the NLP spectrum.
