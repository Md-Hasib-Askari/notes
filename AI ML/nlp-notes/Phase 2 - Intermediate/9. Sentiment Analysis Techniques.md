# Sentiment Analysis Techniques

Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) is the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in text to determine the writer's attitude toward a particular topic, product, service, or event.

## Core Concepts

### Sentiment Analysis Tasks
- **Polarity Classification**: Identifying positive, negative, or neutral sentiment
- **Emotion Detection**: Detecting specific emotions (happiness, anger, sadness, etc.)
- **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**: Identifying sentiment toward specific aspects or features
- **Intensity Analysis**: Measuring the strength of sentiment

### Levels of Analysis
- **Document-level**: Overall sentiment of an entire document
- **Sentence-level**: Sentiment of individual sentences
- **Aspect-level**: Sentiment toward specific entities and their aspects
- **Comparative**: Comparing sentiments between entities

## Traditional Approaches

### Lexicon-Based Methods
Using sentiment dictionaries where words are assigned sentiment scores:

```python
# Simple lexicon-based approach
positive_words = {'good', 'excellent', 'great', 'fantastic', 'happy'}
negative_words = {'bad', 'terrible', 'awful', 'disappointing', 'sad'}

def basic_sentiment(text):
    words = text.lower().split()
    positive_count = sum(1 for word in words if word in positive_words)
    negative_count = sum(1 for word in words if word in negative_words)
    
    if positive_count > negative_count:
        return "Positive"
    elif negative_count > positive_count:
        return "Negative"
    else:
        return "Neutral"
```

#### Popular Sentiment Lexicons
- **VADER** (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)
- **SentiWordNet**: WordNet synsets with sentiment scores
- **LIWC** (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count)
- **AFINN**: List of words with intensity scores

```python
from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

# Initialize VADER
sid = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

# Get sentiment scores
text = "The movie was absolutely amazing! I loved every minute of it."
scores = sid.polarity_scores(text)
print(scores)
# Output: {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.414, 'pos': 0.586, 'compound': 0.8442}
```

### Rule-Based Systems
Incorporating linguistic rules to handle:
- **Negation**: "not good" â‰  "good"
- **Intensifiers**: "very good" > "good"
- **Adversative conjunctions**: "good but overpriced"

### Machine Learning Approaches

#### Feature Engineering for Sentiment Analysis
- **Bag-of-Words/TF-IDF**: Word frequency features
- **N-grams**: Capturing short phrases
- **POS tags**: Emphasizing sentiment-bearing parts of speech
- **Syntactic features**: Dependency relations

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

# Create pipeline
sentiment_classifier = Pipeline([
    ('vectorizer', CountVectorizer(ngram_range=(1, 2))),
    ('classifier', LogisticRegression())
])

# Train on labeled data
X_train = ["I love this product", "Terrible experience", "Not bad at all"]
y_train = ["positive", "negative", "positive"]
sentiment_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict sentiment
sentiment_classifier.predict(["The service was excellent"])
```

## Deep Learning Approaches

### Word Embeddings for Sentiment
- Using pre-trained embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
- Learning task-specific sentiment embeddings

### CNN for Sentiment Analysis
Effective at capturing local patterns and n-gram features:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, Conv1D, GlobalMaxPooling1D, Dense

# CNN model
model = Sequential([
    Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=max_length),
    Conv1D(128, 5, activation='relu'),
    GlobalMaxPooling1D(),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

### RNN/LSTM Models
Better at capturing sequential patterns and context:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM

# LSTM model
model = Sequential([
    Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=max_length),
    LSTM(128, dropout=0.2, recurrent_dropout=0.2),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```

### Transformer-Based Models
State-of-the-art performance using pre-trained language models:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Using pre-trained BERT for sentiment analysis
sentiment_analyzer = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

# Analyze text
result = sentiment_analyzer("I've been waiting for this movie and it did not disappoint!")
print(result)
# Output: [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998}]
```

## Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)

### Task Definition
Identifying sentiment toward specific aspects or features:
- "The battery life is excellent but the camera quality is poor."
  - Aspect: battery life, Sentiment: positive
  - Aspect: camera quality, Sentiment: negative

### Implementation Approaches
- **Pipeline approach**: Extract aspects, then determine sentiment
- **Joint learning**: Simultaneously identify aspects and sentiment
- **Attention mechanisms**: Focus on relevant parts of text for each aspect

```python
# Simplified ABSA using spaCy and rule-based approach
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

def extract_aspects_with_sentiment(text, aspect_terms, sentiment_lexicon):
    doc = nlp(text)
    results = []
    
    for sent in doc.sents:
        sent_text = sent.text.lower()
        
        # Find aspects in the sentence
        for aspect in aspect_terms:
            if aspect.lower() in sent_text:
                # Determine sentiment window
                window_words = sent_text.split()
                
                # Simple sentiment scoring
                sentiment_score = 0
                for word in window_words:
                    if word in sentiment_lexicon:
                        sentiment_score += sentiment_lexicon[word]
                
                # Determine sentiment label
                if sentiment_score > 0:
                    sentiment = "positive"
                elif sentiment_score < 0:
                    sentiment = "negative"
                else:
                    sentiment = "neutral"
                
                results.append({
                    "aspect": aspect,
                    "sentiment": sentiment,
                    "sentence": sent.text
                })
    
    return results
```

## Cross-Domain Sentiment Analysis

### Domain Adaptation Techniques
- **Transfer learning**: Fine-tuning pre-trained models
- **Domain-adversarial training**: Learning domain-invariant features
- **Semi-supervised approaches**: Using unlabeled target domain data

## Contextual Challenges

### Handling Negation
- **Negation scope detection**: Identifying affected terms
- **Negation representation**: Explicit marking or learned embeddings

### Sarcasm and Irony Detection
- Using contextual cues and incongruity
- Multi-modal signals (in social media)

### Implicit Sentiment
- Statements without explicit sentiment terms
- "I had to charge my phone three times today"

## Evaluation
