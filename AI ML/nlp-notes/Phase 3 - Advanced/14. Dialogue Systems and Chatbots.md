# Dialogue Systems and Chatbots

Dialogue systems and chatbots enable interactive communication between humans and machines using natural language. These systems range from simple rule-based chatbots to sophisticated conversational AI capable of maintaining context and generating coherent multi-turn responses.

## Types of Dialogue Systems

1. **Rule-based systems**: Use predefined patterns and templates
2. **Retrieval-based systems**: Select responses from a predefined set
3. **Generative systems**: Create novel responses using language models
4. **Task-oriented systems**: Focus on helping users complete specific tasks
5. **Open-domain systems**: Handle a wide range of topics and conversations

## Retrieval-Based Dialogue System

Retrieval-based systems select the most appropriate response from a collection:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import pandas as pd

class RetrievalChatbot:
    def __init__(self, dialogue_pairs):
        """
        Initialize a retrieval-based chatbot
        
        Args:
            dialogue_pairs: List of (query, response) tuples
        """
        self.queries = [pair[0] for pair in dialogue_pairs]
        self.responses = [pair[1] for pair in dialogue_pairs]
        
        # Initialize TF-IDF vectorizer
        self.vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
        self.query_vectors = self.vectorizer.fit_transform(self.queries)
    
    def get_response(self, user_input, top_k=3):
        """Get most relevant response to user input"""
        # Vectorize user input
        user_vector = self.vectorizer.transform([user_input])
        
        # Calculate similarity with all queries
        similarities = cosine_similarity(user_vector, self.query_vectors)[0]
        
        # Get top-k closest matches
        top_indices = np.argsort(similarities)[-top_k:][::-1]
        
        # Return best response
        best_idx = top_indices[0]
        confidence = similarities[best_idx]
        
        # If confidence is too low, return fallback
        if confidence < 0.3:
            return "I'm not sure how to respond to that. Could you rephrase?"
        
        return self.responses[best_idx]

# Example usage
dialogue_pairs = [
    ("Hello, how are you?", "I'm doing well, thanks for asking!"),
    ("What's your name?", "I'm ChatBot, a conversational AI assistant."),
    ("Tell me about yourself", "I'm a dialogue system designed to have conversations."),
    ("How does machine learning work?", "Machine learning is a method where computers learn from data."),
    # Add many more pairs for better coverage
]

chatbot = RetrievalChatbot(dialogue_pairs)

# Example conversation
user_input = "Hi, how are you doing today?"
response = chatbot.get_response(user_input)
print(f"User: {user_input}")
print(f"Bot: {response}")
```

## Generative Dialogue with Transformers

Transformer-based models can generate contextually appropriate responses:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

class GenerativeChatbot:
    def __init__(self, model_name="microsoft/DialoGPT-medium"):
        """Initialize a generative chatbot using a pre-trained model"""
        self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
        self.model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
        self.chat_history_ids = None
    
    def get_response(self, user_input, max_length=1000):
        """Generate a response based on the conversation history"""
        # Tokenize user input
        user_input_ids = self.tokenizer.encode(user_input + self.tokenizer.eos_token, return_tensors="pt")
        
        # Append to chat history or start new conversation
        if self.chat_history_ids is not None:
            bot_input_ids = torch.cat([self.chat_history_ids, user_input_ids], dim=-1)
        else:
            bot_input_ids = user_input_ids
        
        # Generate response
        self.chat_history_ids = self.model.generate(
            bot_input_ids, 
            max_length=max_length,
            pad_token_id=self.tokenizer.eos_token_id,
            no_repeat_ngram_size=3,
            do_sample=True,
            top_k=50,
            top_p=0.9,
            temperature=0.7
        )
        
        # Extract response (excluding user input)
        response = self.tokenizer.decode(
            self.chat_history_ids[:, bot_input_ids.shape[-1]:][0], 
            skip_special_tokens=True
        )
        
        return response
    
    def reset_conversation(self):
        """Reset the conversation history"""
        self.chat_history_ids = None

# Example usage
chatbot = GenerativeChatbot()

# Multi-turn conversation
responses = []
user_inputs = [
    "Hello, how are you today?",
    "What can you help me with?",
    "Tell me a fun fact about machine learning."
]

for user_input in user_inputs:
    response = chatbot.get_response(user_input)
    responses.append(response)
    print(f"User: {user_input}")
    print(f"Bot: {response}")
    print("----")
```

## Task-Oriented Dialogue System

Task-oriented systems help users accomplish specific goals:

```python
class TaskOrientedBot:
    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize a task-oriented bot for restaurant booking"""
        # Define required slots
        self.slots = {
            "cuisine": None,
            "location": None,
            "price_range": None,
            "date": None,
            "time": None,
            "num_people": None
        }
        
        # Current dialogue state
        self.current_slot = None
        self.confirmed = False
        
        # Define slot-filling questions
        self.questions = {
            "cuisine": "What type of cuisine are you looking for?",
            "location": "Where would you like to find a restaurant?",
            "price_range": "What price range are you looking for? (budget, mid-range, high-end)",
            "date": "What date would you like to book?",
            "time": "What time would you like to book?",
            "num_people": "How many people will be dining?"
        }
        
        # Simple NLU rules
        self.slot_patterns = {
            "cuisine": ["italian", "chinese", "indian", "mexican", "japanese", "french"],
            "price_range": ["cheap", "budget", "affordable", "expensive", "high-end", "mid-range"],
            # Add more patterns for other slots
        }
    
    def extract_slot_values(self, user_input):
        """Simple slot value extraction based on keywords"""
        extracted = {}
        
        # Check for cuisine types
        for cuisine in self.slot_patterns["cuisine"]:
            if cuisine in user_input.lower():
                extracted["cuisine"] = cuisine
        
        # Check for price ranges
        for price in self.slot_patterns["price_range"]:
            if price in user_input.lower():
                extracted["price_range"] = price
        
        # Add more slot extractions based on patterns or NER
        
        return extracted
    
    def get_response(self, user_input):
        """Process user input and generate system response"""
        # Extract slot values from user input
        extracted_slots = self.extract_slot_values(user_input)
        
        # Update slots with extracted values
        for slot, value in extracted_slots.items():
            self.slots[slot] = value
        
        # If confirmation requested
        if "confirm" in user_input.lower() or "book" in user_input.lower():
            if all(self.slots.values()):
                self.confirmed = True
                return f"Great! I've booked a {self.slots['price_range']} {self.slots['cuisine']} restaurant in {self.slots['location']} for {self.slots['num_people']} people on {self.slots['date']} at {self.slots['time']}."
            else:
                # Find missing slots
                missing = [slot for slot, value in self.slots.items() if value is None]
                self.current_slot = missing[0]
                return f"I still need some information. {self.questions[self.current_slot]}"
        
        # Find next empty slot
        empty_slots = [slot for slot, value in self.slots.items() if value is None]
        if empty_slots:
            self.current_slot = empty_slots[0]
            return self.questions[self.current_slot]
        else:
            return "Is that all correct? Say 'confirm' to book the restaurant."

# Example usage
restaurant_bot = TaskOrientedBot()
responses = []

conversation = [
    "I want to book a restaurant",
    "I'd like Italian food",
    "New York City",
    "Mid-range price",
    "Next Friday",
    "7:30 PM",
    "4 people",
    "Yes, confirm the booking"
]

for user_input in conversation:
    response = restaurant_bot.get_response(user_input)
    print(f"User: {user_input}")
    print(f"Bot: {response}")
    print("----")
```

## Evaluating Dialogue Systems

Several metrics are used to evaluate dialogue systems:

1. **Human evaluation**: Ratings for coherence, relevance, and engagement
2. **Task completion rate**: For task-oriented systems
3. **Turn-level metrics**: Perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE
4. **Dialogue-level metrics**: Coherence, diversity, consistency

## Best Practices

1. **Handle common issues**:
   - Out-of-domain questions
   - Repetitive responses
   - Context management
   - Appropriate fallbacks

2. **User experience considerations**:
   - Personalization
   - Response latency
   - Conversational flow
   - Error recovery

3. **Ethical considerations**:
   - Bias mitigation
   - Toxicity prevention
   - Privacy protection
   - Transparency about AI nature

## Applications

1. **Customer support**: Automated assistance and FAQ answering
2. **Virtual assistants**: Task completion and information retrieval
3. **Therapy and wellbeing**: Mental health support conversations
4. **Education**: Interactive learning and tutoring
5. **Entertainment**: Conversational companions and game characters

Modern dialogue systems increasingly combine the strengths of retrieval and generative approaches, along with specialized components for intent recognition, entity extraction, and dialogue state tracking to create more natural, coherent, and helpful conversational experiences.
