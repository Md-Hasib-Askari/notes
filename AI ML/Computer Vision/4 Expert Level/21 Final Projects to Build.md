## üß™ Topic 21: **Final Projects to Build**

### üéØ Goal:

Build **real-world, portfolio-grade** computer vision projects that cover detection, recognition, generation, and deployment ‚Äî the full stack.

---

### üßë‚Äçüíª 1. **Face Recognition Security App**

**What it does:**

* Detects and recognizes faces in real-time from a webcam
* Logs recognized faces with timestamps
* Sends alerts on unknown/liveness-failed entries

**Stack:**

* `DeepFace` or `FaceNet` for face recognition
* `OpenCV` or `YOLOv8` for face detection
* `FastAPI + SQLite` for logging and web interface

---

### üïµÔ∏è 2. **Real-Time Object Detection App**

**What it does:**

* Uses webcam or IP camera feed to detect objects live
* Optional: real-time dashboard (stream + stats)

**Stack:**

* `YOLOv8` or `TensorRT` for inference
* `OpenCV` or `streamlit` for UI
* `Docker` + `ONNX` for optimized deployment

---

### üìÑ 3. **OCR Document Scanner**

**What it does:**

* Accepts scanned documents or photos
* Extracts and structures data (e.g., invoices, ID cards)
* Can handle handwriting and multilingual text

**Stack:**

* `EasyOCR`, `Tesseract`, or `TrOCR`
* `Pillow`/`OpenCV` for preprocessing
* `Streamlit` or `Flask` frontend

---

### üé• 4. **AI-based Motion Detection for CCTV**

**What it does:**

* Monitors CCTV footage (e.g., your Imou IPC-F22F)
* Triggers alerts on **human activity** or **unusual behavior**
* Optional: anomaly detection or tracking

**Stack:**

* `YOLOv8` + `ByteTrack` or `DeepSort` for tracking
* Unsupervised anomaly detection (Autoencoder / Isolation Forest)
* Use `FFmpeg` or `OpenCV` for video streaming

---

### üîç 5. **Visual Search Engine (like Google Lens)**

**What it does:**

* Upload an image ‚Üí returns similar images or matching objects
* Supports product search, scene tagging, etc.

**Stack:**

* `CLIP` for image embedding
* `FAISS` or `Weaviate` for similarity search
* `FastAPI` + `React/Next.js` frontend

### üß† Bonus Project Ideas:

| Idea                       | Highlights                                    |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Image Captioning Tool**  | Use BLIP or OFA to auto-caption photos        |
| **Multi-modal VQA bot**    | Ask questions about an image (BLIP + chatbot) |
| **SAM + CLIP Segmenter**   | Point and label objects by text in an image   |
| **AI Photo Enhancer**      | Super-resolution + denoising with ESRGAN      |
| **AI Number Plate Reader** | Detect and read car plates in traffic footage |

## üöÄ Deployment Tips:

* Use `Docker` to containerize everything
* Convert models to `ONNX` or `TFLite` for edge deployment
* Use `Streamlit`, `Gradio`, or `FastAPI` for your UI/API
* For real-time: optimize with `TensorRT` or `OpenVINO`

---

## üß∞ Tools to Use:

* Annotation: Roboflow, CVAT, LabelImg
* Model Training: YOLOv8, Detectron2, BLIP, Hugging Face
* Hosting: Hugging Face Spaces, Render, Railway, or local API
* Frontends: Streamlit, Gradio, or custom UI
