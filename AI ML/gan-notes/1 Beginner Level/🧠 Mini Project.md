# ðŸ§  Mini Project

## Project: MNIST/Fashion-MNIST GAN Generator

### Objective
Build a complete GAN system to generate realistic handwritten digits (MNIST) or clothing items (Fashion-MNIST) and demonstrate your understanding of fundamental GAN concepts.

### Requirements
1. Implement a vanilla GAN architecture for either MNIST or Fashion-MNIST
2. Train the model for sufficient iterations to produce recognizable outputs
3. Document the training process and challenges encountered
4. Visualize generated samples at different training stages
5. Evaluate your model using visual inspection and basic metrics
6. Experiment with at least 2 different hyperparameter configurations

### Deliverables
1. Complete code implementation (Python with PyTorch/TensorFlow)
2. Training logs showing generator and discriminator loss
3. Generated sample grid images from different training epochs
4. Brief report documenting:
   - Architecture decisions
   - Training strategy
   - Challenges encountered
   - Results analysis
   - Potential improvements

### Extension Ideas
- Add conditioning to generate specific digits/items
- Experiment with different noise distributions
- Implement one training stabilization technique
- Create an animation showing generation progress over time
