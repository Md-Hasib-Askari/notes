# ðŸ§  Mini Projects

## Project 1: Style Transfer GAN

### Objective
Implement a GAN-based style transfer system capable of transferring artistic styles to photographs.

### Requirements
1. Implement either a CycleGAN or conditional GAN architecture
2. Train on a dataset of artistic images and photographs
3. Apply multiple training stability techniques
4. Use proper evaluation metrics to assess quality
5. Document the entire process and architectural decisions

### Deliverables
- Complete implementation code
- Training logs and visualizations
- Sample output gallery
- Technical report with methodology and analysis

## Project 2: Face Attribute Manipulation

### Objective
Create a GAN system that can manipulate specific facial attributes (age, expression, hair color, etc.).

### Requirements
1. Implement a conditional GAN architecture
2. Use a labeled facial dataset (e.g., CelebA)
3. Enable control over at least 3 different attributes
4. Apply appropriate evaluation metrics
5. Demonstrate smooth attribute interpolation

### Deliverables
- Complete implementation code
- Interactive demo (if possible)
- Before/after transformation gallery
- Technical report with methodology and analysis

## Project 3: High-Resolution Image Generation

### Objective
Build a GAN capable of generating high-resolution (at least 128Ã—128) images with high fidelity.

### Requirements
1. Implement a progressive growing architecture or similar
2. Train on a dataset of your choice
3. Apply at least 3 training stabilization techniques
4. Use proper evaluation metrics (FID, etc.)
5. Document challenges and solutions

### Deliverables
- Complete implementation code
- Generated image gallery
- Training progression visualization
- Technical report with methodology and analysis
