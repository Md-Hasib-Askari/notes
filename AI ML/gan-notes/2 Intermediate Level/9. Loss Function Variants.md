## 🟡 Intermediate Level – Step 9: **Loss Function Variants**

### 🎯 Goal:

Learn different GAN loss functions that **improve training stability**, fix gradient issues, and reduce mode collapse.

---

## 💣 Why Change the Loss?

The original GAN uses **Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)**, but it can suffer from:

* **Vanishing gradients** (especially when D is too good)
* **Training instability**
* **Mode collapse**

### 🧪 Alternatives:

---

### 1. **Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)** 🚰

#### 📌 Key Ideas:

* Replace JS divergence with **Earth Mover’s (Wasserstein-1) distance**.
* **No sigmoid** in D.
* D is now called a **Critic**, and outputs real values instead of probabilities.
* Use **weight clipping** to enforce Lipschitz constraint.

#### 🧠 Loss:

**Critic (D):**

$$
\mathcal{L}_D = \mathbb{E}[D(x_{real})] - \mathbb{E}[D(G(z))]
$$

**Generator (G):**

$$
\mathcal{L}_G = -\mathbb{E}[D(G(z))]
$$

#### 💥 Benefits:

* Much more **stable gradients**
* Works even when D is strong
* Great for fixing **mode collapse**

#### ❌ Problems:

* Weight clipping is crude → leads to optimization issues

---

### 2. **WGAN-GP (Gradient Penalty)** ✅ **Recommended**

#### 📌 Fixes weight clipping with **gradient penalty**:

Adds a term to the Critic’s loss to enforce the Lipschitz constraint more softly.

$$
\mathcal{L}_{GP} = \lambda \cdot (\|\nabla_{\hat{x}} D(\hat{x})\|_2 - 1)^2
$$

* $\hat{x}$ = interpolated real and fake samples
* $\lambda$ = typically 10

**Total Critic Loss**:

$$
\mathcal{L}_D = \mathbb{E}[D(G(z))] - \mathbb{E}[D(x)] + \lambda \cdot \text{GP}
$$

---

### 3. **Least Squares GAN (LSGAN)**

#### 📌 Replace BCE loss with **MSE loss**:

**Discriminator:**

$$
\mathcal{L}_D = \frac{1}{2}(D(x) - 1)^2 + \frac{1}{2}(D(G(z)))^2
$$

**Generator:**

$$
\mathcal{L}_G = \frac{1}{2}(D(G(z)) - 1)^2
$$

#### 💥 Benefits:

* Better gradients than BCE
* Works well on **simple datasets** (e.g., MNIST)

---

### 4. **Hinge Loss (used in BigGAN, SN-GAN)**

#### 📌 Margin-based loss for D and G:

**Discriminator:**

$$
\mathcal{L}_D = \mathbb{E}[\text{ReLU}(1 - D(x))] + \mathbb{E}[\text{ReLU}(1 + D(G(z)))]
$$

**Generator:**

$$
\mathcal{L}_G = -\mathbb{E}[D(G(z))]
$$

#### 💥 Benefits:

* Sharp gradients
* Used in **high-performance models** (e.g., BigGAN, StyleGAN)

## 🔧 When to Use What

| Loss          | Use When                                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| BCE (vanilla) | Learning GAN basics                                    |
| **WGAN-GP**   | You want stable, scalable GANs                         |
| LSGAN         | Training on simple, low-res datasets                   |
| Hinge Loss    | You want state-of-the-art results (with spectral norm) |
