## 🔴 Advanced Level – Step 14: **Unsupervised & Self-Supervised GANs**

### 🎯 Goal:

Learn how to build GANs that can:

* Discover structure in data without labels
* Cluster images by content
* Leverage contrastive learning for better representation

---

## 🧠 1. **Contrastive GANs**

### 🔍 Concept:

Use **contrastive learning** within the GAN to improve the discriminator’s understanding of semantic similarity.

#### 🔧 How it works:

* The Discriminator learns **feature embeddings** of images.
* Instead of just real/fake, it uses a **contrastive loss**:

  * Pulls together **real-real** or **fake-fake** samples
  * Pushes apart **real-fake** pairs

#### 📌 Common Loss: **InfoNCE**

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{contrastive}} = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(x_i, x_j)/\tau)}{\sum_k \exp(\text{sim}(x_i, x_k)/\tau)}
$$

> $\text{sim}(a,b)$ is cosine similarity, $\tau$ is temperature.

#### ✅ Benefits:

* Better discriminator features
* **Improved Generator quality** (even if G isn’t directly optimized with contrastive loss)

## 🧠 2. **Unsupervised Image Clustering with GANs**

### 🔍 Goal:

Use a GAN to **discover classes or clusters** in data — without labels.

#### 🧩 Techniques:

* Cluster in latent space of `G(z)`
* Use **InfoGAN** or **DiscoGAN** to identify interpretable factors
* Apply **k-means** on feature embeddings from Discriminator or Q-network

#### ✅ Example:

* Cluster MNIST digits without labels
* Find semantic categories in CelebA (e.g., hair color, expression)

---

## 🧠 3. **Semi-Supervised GANs**

### 🔍 Use a small set of labeled data to **guide learning** while the majority of training data is unlabeled.

#### 🔧 Approach:

* Modify **Discriminator** to output `K + 1` classes:

  * `K` real classes (e.g., digits 0–9)
  * `+1` = fake samples

#### 🧪 Loss:

* Cross-entropy for labeled data
* GAN loss for fake data

#### ✅ Results:

* Strong classifiers with **<10% labeled data**
* Used in **Improved GANs** (Salimans et al.)

---

## 🧠 4. **Self-Supervised GAN Training**

### 🔍 Use **pretext tasks** to improve GAN performance:

* **Rotation prediction** (predict angle the image is rotated)
* **Jigsaw puzzles**, **colorization**, **inpainting**

These tasks train the **Discriminator** to learn **useful representations** even without labels.

> Example: BigBiGAN uses self-supervised encoders + GAN loss
