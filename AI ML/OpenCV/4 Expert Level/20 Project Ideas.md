### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Real-time Face Mask Detector**

ðŸ§  Skills: OpenCV DNN, face detection, TensorFlow/PyTorch model integration

**Steps:**

* Use `cv2.dnn` or `face_recognition` to detect faces
* Feed cropped faces to a trained mask classifier (e.g., Keras model)
* Show bounding box + mask status

ðŸ“¦ Bonus: Package with PyInstaller for kiosk or gate control

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Lane Detection for Self-Driving Cars**

ðŸ§  Skills: Color filtering, perspective transform, polynomial fitting

**Steps:**

* Use color masks (yellow/white) to segment lanes
* Apply Canny edge + Hough transform or poly fitting
* Overlay lane curves on video feed

ðŸ“¦ Bonus: Run on Raspberry Pi with camera

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Gesture Recognition System**

ðŸ§  Skills: Background subtraction, contour analysis, classification

**Steps:**

* Detect hand ROI using skin color / background subtractor
* Extract features (e.g., Hu moments or contours)
* Classify gestures using a simple CNN

ðŸ“¦ Bonus: Control volume, lights, or apps using gestures

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Barcode & QR Code Scanner**

ðŸ§  Skills: OpenCV + `pyzbar` or `cv2.QRCodeDetector`

**Steps:**

```python
detector = cv2.QRCodeDetector()
val, points, _ = detector.detectAndDecode(frame)
```

ðŸ“¦ Bonus: Display decoded data in real time + link to actions (open URL, copy to clipboard)

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Augmented Reality Overlay**

ðŸ§  Skills: Feature matching, homography, warping

**Steps:**

* Detect planar object (e.g., book cover)
* Compute homography with known template
* Overlay 3D image/video onto the scene using `warpPerspective`

ðŸ“¦ Bonus: Turn a business card into a live video!

### ðŸ§ª Your Challenge

Pick **any one** of the above and build it end-to-end using:

* OpenCV for processing
* Numpy for efficiency
* GUI with Tkinter or Streamlit (optional)
* PyInstaller/Docker for deployment
