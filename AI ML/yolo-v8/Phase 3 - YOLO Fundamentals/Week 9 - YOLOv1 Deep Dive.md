# Week 9: YOLOv1 Deep Dive

## Core Concepts

### Grid-Based Detection Approach
- **Revolutionary Concept**: YOLOv1 treats object detection as a single regression problem
- **Grid Division**: Input image divided into S×S grid (typically 7×7)
- **Cell Responsibility**: Each grid cell predicts objects whose center falls within it
- **Single Pass**: Entire detection pipeline in one forward pass through the network

### Single Forward Pass Philosophy
- **Unified Architecture**: No separate region proposal stage like R-CNN
- **End-to-End Training**: Direct optimization for detection task
- **Speed Advantage**: Real-time inference capability (~45 FPS)
- **Simplicity**: Straightforward architecture compared to two-stage detectors

### Network Architecture and Output Format
```
Input: 448×448×3 image
├── Convolutional Layers (24 layers)
├── Fully Connected Layers (2 layers)
└── Output: 7×7×30 tensor

Output Tensor Structure (7×7×30):
- 7×7 grid cells
- Each cell: 30 values
  ├── Bounding box 1: [x, y, w, h, confidence] (5 values)
  ├── Bounding box 2: [x, y, w, h, confidence] (5 values)
  └── Class probabilities: 20 values (for PASCAL VOC)
```

## Implementation Details

### Loss Function Components
```python
# YOLOv1 Loss Function (conceptual)
loss = λ_coord * localization_loss + 
       confidence_loss + 
       λ_noobj * no_object_loss + 
       classification_loss

# Localization Loss (L2)
localization_loss = Σ[(x_pred - x_true)² + (y_pred - y_true)²] + 
                   Σ[(√w_pred - √w_true)² + (√h_pred - √h_true)²]

# Confidence Loss
confidence_loss = Σ[C_pred - IoU_pred_truth]² (for object cells)
no_object_loss = Σ[C_pred]² (for non-object cells)

# Classification Loss
classification_loss = Σ[(p_pred - p_true)²] (for object cells)
```

### Confidence Score Calculation
- **Definition**: Confidence = Pr(Object) × IoU_pred^truth
- **Object Presence**: Probability that cell contains an object
- **Localization Quality**: IoU between predicted and ground truth boxes
- **Training Target**: IoU for cells with objects, 0 for cells without objects
- **Inference**: Filters out low-confidence detections

### Class Probability Predictions
- **Conditional Probabilities**: Pr(Class_i | Object)
- **Cell-Level Prediction**: Each cell predicts class probabilities
- **Final Classification**: Confidence × Class Probability
- **Multi-Class Support**: Softmax over all classes per cell

## Limitations Understanding

### Why YOLOv1 Struggles with Small Objects
**Grid Resolution**: 7×7 grid creates coarse spatial resolution
```
Image: 448×448 pixels
Grid cell: 64×64 pixels
Small objects: May be smaller than grid cell size
Result: Poor localization and detection
```

**Feature Map Limitations**:
- Single scale detection
- No feature pyramid
- Limited receptive field variety

### Multiple Objects in Same Grid Cell Problem
**One Object Per Cell**: Each cell can only predict one object
```
Scenario: Two objects with centers in same grid cell
├── Car center: (x1, y1) in cell (3,4)
├── Person center: (x2, y2) in cell (3,4)
└── Result: Only one object detected
```

**Competition Effect**: Objects compete for single prediction slot
**Solution in Later Versions**: Anchor boxes and multi-scale detection

### Aspect Ratio Limitations
**Fixed Aspect Ratios**: No anchor boxes to handle varying shapes
**Regression Difficulty**: Network must learn all possible aspect ratios
**Performance Impact**: Poor detection for extreme aspect ratios

## Training Details

### Data Preparation
```python
# Pseudo-code for YOLOv1 target preparation
def prepare_yolo_target(image, annotations):
    grid_size = 7
    num_classes = 20
    target = np.zeros((grid_size, grid_size, 30))
    
    for annotation in annotations:
        center_x, center_y = annotation.center
        grid_x = int(center_x * grid_size)
        grid_y = int(center_y * grid_size)
        
        # Normalize coordinates relative to cell
        rel_x = (center_x * grid_size) - grid_x
        rel_y = (center_y * grid_size) - grid_y
        
        # Set target values
        target[grid_y, grid_x, 0:5] = [rel_x, rel_y, width, height, 1.0]
        target[grid_y, grid_x, class_id + 10] = 1.0
    
    return target
```

### Hyperparameters
- **λ_coord = 5**: Increases localization loss weight
- **λ_noobj = 0.5**: Reduces no-object loss weight
- **Learning Rate**: 0.001 (with scheduling)
- **Batch Size**: 64
- **Epochs**: 135 for PASCAL VOC

## Performance Analysis

1. **Speed**: Real-time inference capability
2. **Simplicity**: Straightforward architecture and training
3. **Global Context**: Sees entire image during prediction

## Practical Implementation Tips

### Code Structure
```python
class YOLOv1(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes=20):
        super().__init__()
        self.backbone = self.create_backbone()
        self.head = self.create_head(num_classes)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        features = self.backbone(x)
        output = self.head(features)
        return output.reshape(-1, 7, 7, 30)
```

### Loss Implementation
```python
def yolo_loss(predictions, targets, lambda_coord=5, lambda_noobj=0.5):
    # Separate predictions
    box_predictions = predictions[..., :10]  # 2 boxes per cell
    confidence_predictions = predictions[..., 10:12]
    class_predictions = predictions[..., 12:]
    
    # Calculate individual loss components
    coord_loss = calculate_coordinate_loss(box_predictions, targets)
    conf_loss = calculate_confidence_loss(confidence_predictions, targets)
    class_loss = calculate_classification_loss(class_predictions, targets)
    
    return lambda_coord * coord_loss + conf_loss + class_loss
```
