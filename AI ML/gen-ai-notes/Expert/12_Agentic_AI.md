## 🔴 **Step 12: Agentic AI / Autonomous Systems**

---

Agentic AI refers to **LLMs that act like autonomous agents** — able to plan, reason, use tools, access memory, and **take action without constant human input**.

Think: ChatGPT browsing the web, AutoGPT completing multi-step tasks, or a bot booking your flights end-to-end.

### 🧠 Core Concepts

---

### 1. **LLM Agents**

An agent = LLM + memory + planning + tools + execution loop.

Popular tools:

* **LangChain**: Framework to build LLM-powered apps and agents
* **CrewAI**: Multi-agent coordination system
* **AutoGPT / BabyAGI**: Autonomous goal-driven agents

---

### 2. **Memory Systems**

Agents need to remember:

* Previous interactions (short-term memory)
* Long-term knowledge (vector DBs, files)

📦 Memory Types:

* **Buffer Memory**: Stores full convo
* **Summary Memory**: Compresses past into summaries
* **Vector Store Memory**: Embeds and retrieves relevant info (e.g., Pinecone, Chroma, FAISS)

---

### 3. **Tool Use (Plugins & APIs)**

Agents use tools to:

* Search the web
* Call APIs
* Read/write files
* Generate code, run it, evaluate result

📚 LangChain Tools:

* `PythonREPLTool` (run Python code)
* `SerpAPI` (search engine)
* `FileToolkit` (file operations)
* Custom API tools via OpenAPI specs

---

### 4. **Planning & Task Decomposition**

Agents break down high-level tasks into steps:

1. “Book me a hotel in Dhaka”
2. → Search hotel APIs
3. → Filter options
4. → Extract details
5. → Book with payment API

🔧 Tools:

* **BabyAGI**: Recurrent task planner
* **CrewAI**: Agent collaboration with roles
* **LangGraph**: Visual state machine for agent flow

### 📌 Project Ideas

#### ✅ Build a LangChain Agent with Memory + Tools

* Give it access to Python, web search, file read/write
* Add vector DB memory with Chroma

#### ✅ Create a CrewAI Multi-Agent Team

* Example: Research Agent + Summary Agent + Report Generator
* Assign each a role and let them collaborate

#### ✅ Clone AutoGPT for a Narrow Domain

* E.g., an AI that plans your diet + groceries + orders from a store
