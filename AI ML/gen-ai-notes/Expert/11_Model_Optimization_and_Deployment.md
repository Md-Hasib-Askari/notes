## 🔴 **Step 11: Model Optimization & Deployment**

---

### 🛠️ 1. **Model Optimization Techniques**

These techniques reduce model size and improve inference speed — crucial for deployment.

#### 🔹 Quantization

* Reduces precision (e.g., float32 → int8)
* Smaller model, faster inference
* Slight tradeoff in accuracy

#### 🔹 Pruning

* Removes redundant weights/connections
* Sparsifies the network
* Can dramatically shrink size without much accuracy loss

#### 🔹 Knowledge Distillation

* Train a smaller “student” model to mimic a larger “teacher”
* Keeps performance close to the original with fewer parameters

### 🧪 2. **Model Export Formats**

To serve your model in production, you often need to **convert it**.

* **ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)**
  Cross-platform format for PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.

* **TorchScript / SavedModel**
  Platform-native export formats for PyTorch and TensorFlow.

* **TensorRT**
  NVIDIA toolkit for ultra-fast inference (used with ONNX or native models)

### 🌐 3. **Serving Techniques**

Choose based on **scale, latency, and platform**.

#### Option A: **FastAPI / Flask / Django**

* Wrap your model with an API
* Good for low-latency, custom endpoints

#### Option B: **Triton Inference Server**

* High-performance inference server by NVIDIA
* Supports batching, versioning, multi-framework support (PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX)

#### Option C: **Hugging Face Inference Endpoints**

* Plug-and-play model serving in the cloud
* Supports autoscaling, custom Docker images, etc.

### ☁️ 4. **Deployment Platforms**

| Platform            | Ideal For             | Notes                           |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 🟢 Google Colab     | Prototyping & demos   | Free GPUs, temporary sessions   |
| 🟣 Hugging Face     | Quick cloud hosting   | Great for models & Gradio demos |
| 🟡 AWS/GCP/Azure    | Production deployment | Expensive, but scalable         |
| 🔵 Streamlit/Gradio | UI + model hosting    | Build interactive apps easily   |
