## 🔵 **Step 9: Multimodal Generative AI**

---

### 🔑 Core Concepts

---

### 1. **CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining)**

Trained to understand **how text and images relate** by learning a **shared embedding space**.

* Input: *(“a photo of a cat”, image of a cat)*
* Objective: Pull related text-image pairs together in vector space, push unrelated ones apart.

📘 Use Cases:

* Image classification with text prompts.
* Visual similarity search.
* Prompt guidance for image generation models (like DALL·E & Stable Diffusion).

### 2. **DALL·E / Midjourney**

> *"An astronaut riding a horse in a futuristic city" → hyper-realistic image*

#### DALL·E:

* Built on GPT + VQVAE or diffusion.
* Can generate, **edit**, or **inpaint** parts of an image with text prompts.

#### Midjourney:

* Uses proprietary techniques and heavy prompt conditioning.
* Stylized art generation based on community and trends.

📌 Key Terms:

* Inpainting
* Outpainting
* Prompt weighting
* Style tokens

### 3. **Flamingo / Gemini / Multimodal LLMs**

These models can **process and generate**:

* 📝 Text
* 🖼️ Images
* 🔊 Audio
* 🎥 Video

#### Example: Google Gemini, DeepMind Flamingo, OpenAI GPT-4o

> “Look at this photo. What is this person holding?”
> → Model analyzes the **image** and **answers in text**.

🧠 Technical Notes:

* Often use **cross-attention** layers between modalities.
* Use **large-scale aligned datasets** like image-caption pairs, videos with subtitles, etc.

### 📌 Project Ideas

#### ✅ Build a Promptable Image Search App

* Upload images.
* Use CLIP to match and rank similar images by prompt.

#### ✅ Multimodal Q\&A Bot

* Input: image + user question.
* Output: model analyzes image and responds (e.g., what’s written on a sign, count objects, etc).
