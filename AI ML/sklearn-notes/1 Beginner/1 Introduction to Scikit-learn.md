### 1. Introduction to Scikit-learn

**What is Scikit-learn?**
Scikit-learn is an open-source Python library used for implementing classical machine learning algorithms efficiently. It is built on top of NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.

**Key Features:**

* Simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.
* Built-in datasets for practice (Iris, Digits, etc.).
* Wide range of ML models: classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction.
* Preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation modules.
* Well-documented API and easy-to-understand syntax.

**Why use Scikit-learn?**

* Consistent API across models
* Lightweight and ideal for prototyping
* Easily integrated into production pipelines
* Works well with pandas and NumPy

**Scikit-learn vs Others:**

| Feature     | Scikit-learn                | TensorFlow/PyTorch          |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| ML Type     | Classical ML                | Deep Learning               |
| Ease of Use | Very easy                   | Requires more setup         |
| Performance | Great for small/medium data | Better for large-scale data |
| Flexibility | Less flexible               | Very flexible               |
