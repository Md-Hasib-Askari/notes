### 16. Scikit-learn Internals

Understanding how scikit-learn works under the hood gives you the ability to build your own estimators and contribute to the library itself.

### 📌 1. How Estimators Work Under the Hood

All scikit-learn models follow a consistent interface:

* `.fit(X, y)` → trains the model
* `.predict(X)` → makes predictions
* `.score(X, y)` → evaluates the model

All estimators inherit from `BaseEstimator`, and transformers inherit from `TransformerMixin`.

✅ Estimator attributes (like `coef_`, `feature_importances_`) are always set during `.fit()`.

### 📌 2. Implementing Custom Models

You can create your own estimators by inheriting from `BaseEstimator` and implementing at least `fit()` and `predict()` methods.

```python
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator

class CustomClassifier(BaseEstimator):
    def __init__(self, threshold=0.5):
        self.threshold = threshold

    def fit(self, X, y):
        self.mean_ = X.mean(axis=0)
        return self

    def predict(self, X):
        return (X.mean(axis=1) > self.threshold).astype(int)
```

✅ Now usable in pipelines and compatible with GridSearchCV.

### 📌 3. Contributing to Scikit-learn

To contribute:

* Fork the [Scikit-learn GitHub repo](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)
* Clone locally and set up using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Follow [contribution guidelines](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html)
* Write unit tests using `pytest` and document with Sphinx-style docstrings

🛠️ Tip: Start by fixing a **good first issue** or improving documentation.
