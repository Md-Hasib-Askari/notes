# Phase 6: Advanced Programming and Automation - Exercise Sheet

## Exercise 1: Biological Entity Class System
Design a comprehensive object-oriented system with classes for `Organism`, `Gene`, `Protein`, and `Experiment`. Implement inheritance where `Bacterium` inherits from `Organism`. Include methods for sequence analysis, growth simulation, and data validation. Add proper exception handling for invalid sequences and experimental parameters.

## Exercise 2: Laboratory Workflow Automation
Create a class hierarchy for laboratory workflows including `Protocol`, `PCRProtocol`, `CultureProtocol`, and `SequencingProtocol`. Implement polymorphism where each protocol type has its own execution method. Include error handling for equipment failures and reagent shortages.

## Exercise 3: NCBI Database Web Scraper
Build a web scraper that extracts bacterial genome information from NCBI. Handle pagination, rate limiting, and authentication. Extract genome size, GC content, assembly level, and publication data. Implement retry logic and respect robots.txt guidelines.

## Exercise 4: PubMed Literature Mining Tool
Create an automated literature search tool that queries PubMed API for microbiology papers. Parse abstracts to extract key terms, study organisms, and methodologies. Handle API rate limits and implement caching. Generate summary reports of research trends over time.

## Exercise 5: Multi-threaded Sequence Analysis Pipeline
Develop a parallel processing pipeline for analyzing multiple bacterial genomes simultaneously. Use multiprocessing to distribute BLAST searches, gene annotation, and comparative analysis across CPU cores. Implement progress tracking and memory management for large datasets.

## Exercise 6: High-Performance OTU Table Processor
Build a memory-efficient processor for large microbiome OTU tables (>1GB). Implement chunked reading, parallel processing for diversity calculations, and optimized data structures. Include profiling tools to measure performance improvements and memory usage.

## Exercise 7: Installable Bioinformatics Package
Create a complete Python package called "microbio-tools" with proper structure (setup.py, __init__.py, modules). Include CLI commands for sequence analysis, data visualization, and file format conversion. Add comprehensive documentation using Sphinx and publish to PyPI test server.

## Exercise 8: Comprehensive Test Suite
Develop a complete testing framework using pytest for a microbiology analysis library. Include unit tests, integration tests, and mock data generation. Test edge cases like empty sequences, corrupted files, and network failures. Implement test coverage reporting and continuous integration setup.

## Exercise 9: REST API for Laboratory Data
Build a REST API using Flask or FastAPI that serves laboratory data. Include endpoints for sample management, experimental results, and data analysis. Implement authentication, rate limiting, and data validation. Add API documentation with interactive examples.

## Exercise 10: Automated Instrument Interface
Create a system that interfaces with laboratory instruments (simulated). Implement classes for different instrument types (plate readers, PCR machines, sequencers). Handle real-time data collection, error detection, and automated report generation. Include logging and monitoring capabilities.
