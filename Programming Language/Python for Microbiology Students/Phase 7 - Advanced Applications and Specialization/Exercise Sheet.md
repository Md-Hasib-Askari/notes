# Phase 7: Advanced Applications and Specialization - Exercise Sheet

## Exercise 1: PyMOL Structural Biology Automation
Create a PyMOL scripting pipeline that automatically analyzes protein structures from the PDB database. Generate scripts to visualize binding sites, calculate surface areas, identify secondary structures, and create publication-quality molecular graphics. Include batch processing for multiple protein structures and automated report generation.

## Exercise 2: Metabolic Pathway Network Analysis
Build a network analysis tool for bacterial metabolic pathways using NetworkX. Import KEGG pathway data, construct network graphs, identify key metabolic hubs, and analyze pathway connectivity. Calculate centrality measures, detect communities, and visualize metabolic flow patterns with interactive plots.

## Exercise 3: Mathematical Model of Microbial Growth
Develop a comprehensive mathematical model for microbial population dynamics including logistic growth, competition between species, and environmental factors. Implement differential equation solvers, parameter estimation from experimental data, and sensitivity analysis. Create interactive visualizations showing population changes over time.

## Exercise 4: R Integration for Specialized Statistics
Create a Python-R bridge for advanced statistical analyses not available in Python. Use rpy2 to perform phylogenetic comparative methods, ecological statistics, and specialized microbiome analyses. Build wrapper functions that handle data conversion between Python and R, and create unified analysis pipelines.

## Exercise 5: Laboratory Instrument Integration System
Design a comprehensive system that interfaces with multiple laboratory instruments (real or simulated). Create device drivers for PCR machines, plate readers, flow cytometers, and sequencers. Implement real-time data acquisition, automated calibration procedures, and equipment scheduling with conflict resolution.

## Exercise 6: Robotic Laboratory Automation
Build a robotic system controller for automated liquid handling and sample processing. Design protocols for DNA extraction, PCR setup, and microbiological culture preparation. Include error detection, recovery procedures, and integration with inventory management systems.

## Exercise 7: Cloud-Based Genomics Pipeline
Develop a scalable genomics analysis pipeline using cloud computing (AWS/GCP simulation). Implement workflow management with Nextflow or Snakemake, containerize analysis steps with Docker, and create auto-scaling compute clusters. Include cost optimization and resource monitoring.

## Exercise 8: LIMS Integration and Data Management
Create a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) integration tool that connects multiple data sources. Build interfaces for sample tracking, results management, and regulatory compliance. Implement data validation, audit trails, and automated report generation for quality assurance.

## Exercise 9: IoT Environmental Monitoring Network
Design an IoT sensor network for monitoring laboratory and growth chamber conditions. Create data loggers for temperature, humidity, pH, and CO2 levels. Implement real-time alerting systems, predictive maintenance, and automated environmental control responses.

## Exercise 10: Reproducible Research Framework
Build a comprehensive framework for reproducible microbiology research. Create project templates with version control, automated documentation generation, containerized analysis environments, and publication-ready output formats. Include data provenance tracking, computational environment capture, and collaborative review workflows.
