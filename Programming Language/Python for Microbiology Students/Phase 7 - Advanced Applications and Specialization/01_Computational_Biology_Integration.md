# Computational Biology Integration

## Overview
Advanced computational biology integrates Python with specialized tools to model and analyze complex biological systems. This phase focuses on structural biology, network analysis, and mathematical modeling specific to microbial research.

## PyMOL Scripting for Structural Biology

PyMOL's Python API enables automated protein structure analysis and visualization:

```python
import pymol
from pymol import cmd

# Load and analyze protein structures
cmd.load("protein.pdb")
cmd.select("active_site", "resi 100-120")
cmd.color("red", "active_site")

# Calculate distances and angles
distance = cmd.get_distance("atom1", "atom2")
```

Applications include:
- Automated structure comparison
- Binding site identification
- Molecular dynamics analysis preparation
- High-throughput structural screening

## Network Analysis for Metabolic Pathways

Using NetworkX and specialized libraries to model microbial metabolism:

```python
import networkx as nx
import pandas as pd

# Create metabolic network
G = nx.DiGraph()
reactions_df = pd.read_csv("metabolic_reactions.csv")

for _, row in reactions_df.iterrows():
    G.add_edge(row['substrate'], row['product'], 
               enzyme=row['enzyme'], pathway=row['pathway'])

# Analyze network properties
centrality = nx.betweenness_centrality(G)
essential_metabolites = sorted(centrality.items(), 
                              key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:10]
```

## Mathematical Modeling

Implementing differential equation models for microbial systems:

```python
from scipy.integrate import odeint
import numpy as np

def growth_model(y, t, r, K):
    """Logistic growth model"""
    N = y[0]
    dNdt = r * N * (1 - N/K)
    return [dNdt]

# Solve and analyze
t = np.linspace(0, 24, 100)
solution = odeint(growth_model, [1], t, args=(0.5, 1000))
```

## R Integration

Leveraging R's specialized packages through Python:

```python
import rpy2.robjects as robjects
from rpy2.robjects.packages import importr

# Use R packages for specialized analysis
vegan = importr('vegan')
phyloseq = importr('phyloseq')

# Perform analysis unavailable in Python
diversity_results = vegan.diversity(otu_matrix, index="shannon")
```

## Best Practices

- Validate models against experimental data
- Document mathematical assumptions
- Use version control for analysis pipelines
- Implement unit tests for computational functions
- Consider computational complexity for large datasets
