### Code Organization
- Module system for logical code separation
- Privacy and encapsulation principles
- File and directory organization patterns
- Workspace management for larger projects

## Common Patterns and Idioms

### Builder Pattern with Structs
```rust
struct Config {
    host: String,
    port: u16,
    timeout: u64,
}

impl Config {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            host: "localhost".to_string(),
            port: 8080,
            timeout: 30,
        }
    }
    
    fn host(mut self, host: impl Into<String>) -> Self {
        self.host = host.into();
        self
    }
    
    fn port(mut self, port: u16) -> Self {
        self.port = port;
        self
    }
}
```

### Error Handling Chain
```rust
fn process_file(path: &str) -> Result<String, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let content = std::fs::read_to_string(path)?;
    let processed = content.trim().to_uppercase();
    Ok(processed)
}
```

### Iterator Transformation Chains
```rust
let results: Vec<_> = data.iter()
    .filter(|item| item.is_valid())
    .map(|item| item.process())
    .collect();
```

## Project Ideas for Practice

### 1. Task Manager CLI
- Use structs for tasks with different priorities
- Implement traits for serialization
- Use collections to store and organize tasks
- Error handling for file I/O operations

### 2. Configuration Manager
- Parse different config formats (JSON, TOML)
- Use enums for different config sources
- Implement validation with custom error types
- Organize with modules for different parsers

### 3. Data Analysis Tool
- Process CSV data with custom types
- Use HashMap for aggregations
- Implement traits for different analysis methods
- Generic functions for different data types

### 4. Simple Web Server
- Define request/response types with enums
- Use Result for error handling
- Implement traits for different handlers
- Organize routes with modules

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Over-engineering with Generics
- **Problem**: Making everything generic when it's not needed
- **Solution**: Start concrete, generalize when you see patterns
- **Tip**: YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) applies to generics too

### Incorrect Error Type Choices
- **Problem**: Using Option when Result is more appropriate
- **Solution**: Option for absence, Result for failure
- **Tip**: If you need to know WHY something failed, use Result

### Poor Collection Choices
- **Problem**: Using Vec for all data storage needs
- **Solution**: Learn the performance characteristics of each collection
- **Tip**: HashMap for key-value lookups, HashSet for uniqueness, Vec for ordered data

### Module Over-organization
- **Problem**: Creating too many small modules too early
- **Solution**: Start with larger modules, split when they grow
- **Tip**: Modules should group related functionality, not just reduce file size

## Next Steps
